Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they \nwere in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the ...	1	\N	By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson\nPfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.\nBoth New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.\nAllergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.\nPfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\nA spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n"Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas," Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: "The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them."\nFrom the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.\nSMOOTHER PATH\n"These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore," he said in a statement. "We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."\nBillionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.\nAnalysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.\nCredit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.\nEarlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.\n"Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses," Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. "I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back."\nPfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.\nGiven that both sides characterized the talks as "friendly," Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.\n"It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca," said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. "The hurdle will really be the price."\nMoody's Investor Service said the deal would have "credit positive implications for both companies."\nA tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.\nRead said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.\nPfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.\nAllergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.\nCASH FROM BOTOX\nA purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.\nIt would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.\nAllergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.\nPfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.\nSince the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.\nThe deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.\nApart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.\nBy Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOther large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.\n(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb )\nTraders gather at the post that trades Allergan stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange October 29, 2015.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:11.18217-06

(Spencer Platt)\nMichael Hiltzik Contact Reporter The Economy Hub\nA corporate tax dodge known as "inversions" had a moment in the spotlight about a year ago, when a number of such high-profile mergers got U.S. Treasury officials, politicians and voters steaming. \nInversions are mergers in which a big U.S. company buys a smaller foreign company and reincorporates in the foreign land to take advantage of its lower corporate tax rate. Following the public uproar and a tightening of Treasury rules--and a public denunciation  from President Obama --inversions ebbed, for a bit. (We reported on the inversion craze here ,  here  and here .)\nThe shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return. - Pfizer Chairman Ian Read\nBut a huge merger being discussed by Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan has revived the specter of these tax-advantaged flights of corporate assets from U.S. shores. The deal, which the companies say is under "preliminary" discussion, would create the world's largest drugmaker, valued at more than $300 billion.\nIt also would lower Pfizer's effective U.S. tax rate--though by how much isn't clear, since many critics think the company's declared effective rate of 25.5% in 2014 is vastly overstated. The key may be that the deal would relieve Pfizer of the potential tax burden of as much as $148 billion  in overseas earnings it has stashed overseas. That money would be subject to U.S. taxes if brought home, but might be permanently sheltered under the terms of an inversion merger.\nThe Inversion Craze\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004.\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004. (Congressional Research Service)\nPfizer has been among the nation's most aggressive exploiters of U.S. tax breaks by booking business expenses in the U.S. and shifting income abroad, according to critics such as Americans for Tax Fairness. In a report  issued this month, the organization asserted that Pfizer's effective tax rate last year actually was only 7.5%, not 25.5%. The discrepancy was due to "accounting fiction," including the reporting of "deferred taxes" that the company is unlikely to pay in the future. \nPfizer maintains that its income policies and tax reporting comply with all government rules and regulations. No one has shown they don't.\nWhat's unclear is why Pfizer would aggressively overstate its tax bite, since that means understating its earnings. Among the possibilities, experts say, is that the company fears that revealing its inordinately low real tax rate might attract unwelcome attention from pharmaceutical and tax regulators. Or it might be building up a reserve of deferred taxes to apply to any overseas earnings it eventually repatriates to the U.S., whether under orders from U.S. tax authorities or voluntarily, as part of a partial amnesty.\nClose loopholes that let U.S. firms avoid taxes by using inversions Michael Hiltzik It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... (Michael Hiltzik)\nInversions aren't illegal, though they have been politically touchy. Pfizer Chairman Ian Read acknowledged as much during a conference call with securities analysts  Oct. 27, but said the "political ramifications" wouldn't stop him from taking any step he judged to be in his shareholders' and employees' interests. "The shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return," he said, "and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust, successful company."\nThe political issues can't be dismissed so lightly, however. Obama took aim  last year at companies he called "corporate deserters--a small but growing group of big corporations that are fleeing the country to get out of paying taxes.... They’re declaring they’re based someplace else even though most of their operations are here."  \nA tightening of regulations by the Treasury Department last year succeeded in quashing several large inversion deals. Among other things, tax officials are certain to be on the lookout for any merger-related maneuvers that seem aimed at reducing the percentage of Pfizer shareholders still holding interests in the merged companies. That's a key metric followed by the Treasury. These steps could include spinoffs of existing businesses or stock buybacks that pay off shareholders with cash.\nA Pfizer deal might also spur Congress and the White House to finally make a permanent deal on corporate taxes--which could be good or bad for companies like Pfizer, depending on the terms. \nThat effort should start with a two-year moratorium on all inversions "to reduce the hemorrhaging," suggests Edward D. Kleinbard , a USC law professor whose role as a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation certifies him as one of our leading experts on the corporate tax.\nKleinbard argues that the elements of a new corporate tax structure have long been clear on both sides of the partisan aisle. "The scope of disagreement between [House Speaker Paul] Ryan and President Obama is so small that they could work out the bullet points in the course of a weekend," he says. \nThe points would include reducing the corporate tax rate, which tops out at 35%, to somewhere around 25% while eliminating a host of corporate tax rates and taxing earnings on a territorial basis--that is, levying U.S. tax chiefly on income earned within the U.S., perhaps with a lower but minimum tax on foreign earnings. That would encourage companies to bring foreign earnings back to the U.S., where they could be invested in the U.S. economy.\nSuch changes might not quell the incessant whining by American companies about our high corporate tax rate--although, as Pfizer shows, they rarely pay anything approaching the statutory rate. But in practical terms it might quell their appetite for merger deals that make sense largely as tax maneuvers. American business ingenuity is almost limitless, and it might do everyone good for it to be applied to developing useful new drugs and other products, instead of tax schemes.\nKeep up to date with the Economy Hub.

With a research and development budget of $7.1 billion in 2003, the new Pfizer is now the world's leading research-based pharmaceutical company.\n"Today we go forward as a single company, providing more products to help more patients than any other pharmaceutical company has ever done before," said Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hank McKinnell. "On any given day, we estimate that nearly 40 million people around the world are treated with a Pfizer medicine. Our new company is the global leader in discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines and health care solutions essential to improving global public health and addressing unmet medical needs."\nPharmacia Corporation: A History\nThe roots of Pharmacia Corporation date back over 150 years to 1837 when a leading Italian pharmacist, Carlo Erba, started his own company, which later became Farmitalia Carlo Erba. This company would later unite with Kabi Pharmacia, which began in 1951. These two companies, along with Pharmacia Aktiebolaget, formed the three main points of origin for Pharmacia AB, which was established in Sweden in 1911.\nIn the United States, Pharmacia traces its roots back to 1886. It was then that W.E. Upjohn, M.D., established The Upjohn Pill and Granule Company of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (USA). The company continued its growth throughout the 19th century, eventually evolving into an innovative, international company. Two years later, the Searle and Hereth Co. was formed by a young druggist named Gideon Daniel Searle, as an innovative company developing many "firsts." These firsts include the first bulk laxative, the first motion sickness drug, the first oral contraceptive, the first once-a-day calcium channel blocker for the treatment of hypertension, and many other innovative products. Likewise, Searle discovered and introduced aspartame, a hugely successful sugar substitute. The Searle and Hereth Co. was incorporated in 1908 as G.D. Searle and Co. in Chicago, and in 1985, became the pharmaceutical unit of Monsanto.\nIn 1995, Pharmacia & Upjohn was formed through the merger of Pharmacia AB and The Upjohn Company. Pharmacia & Upjohn became a global provider of human health care products, animal health products, diagnostics and specialty products. In 1998, Pharmacia & Upjohn relocated its global headquarters from the United Kingdom to the United States.\nIn April 2000, Pharmacia & Upjohn completed a merger with Monsanto and Searle creating Pharmacia, a dynamic new competitor in the pharmaceutical industry. This top-tier company's innovative medicines and other products saved the lives of many and enhanced health and wellness. Following the merger, Pharmacia continued Searle's agreement with Pfizer to co-promote Celebrex, which was originally co-developed by Searle and Pfizer.\nIn August 2002, Pharmacia completed the spin-off of its agricultural subsidiary, Monsanto Company.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:11.233862-06
9	1	The Pfizer–Allergan Merger Is a Disgrace - The New Yorker	http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace	Nov 23, 2015 ... John Cassidy writes about the proposed merger between pharmaceutical giant \nPfizer and an Ireland-based competitor, Allergan.	9	\N	Ian Read, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, says merging with Allergan would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.” Credit Photograph by Ben Cawthra / Rex Features via AP\nIn an announcement on Monday morning,  Pfizer , the big drug company, whose headquarters are on East 42nd Street, in Manhattan, said that it is merging with one of its competitors, Allergan PLC. Ian Read, a Scottish-born accountant who is Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said that the proposed deal, which is valued at a hundred and sixty billion dollars, would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”\nOn Wall Street and in the world of big pharma, that statement will raise chuckles. It is widely acknowledged that the primary impetus for the deal is a financial one. In merging with Allergan , which is based in Dublin, Pfizer intends to move its corporate residency to Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 per cent, compared to thirty-five per cent for a company of its size in the United States. Over the next few years, the merger could save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes and deprive the U.S. Treasury of the same amount.\nTax-driven deals of this nature are known as “ inversions ,” and they are becoming increasingly common. Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad. Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  said that inversions were “wrong,”  and that he would try and restrict them. Only last week, the Treasury Department  issued some new administrative guidelines in this area. Without actual legislation, though, there isn’t very much the Obama Administration can do to prevent these exercises in corporate tax-dodging, and Republicans on Capitol Hill have displayed little eagerness to coöperate in a crackdown.\nThe Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace. Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Now, Pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, particularly profits generated by its overseas subsidiaries. Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.\nFounded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals. Its first commercial product was an anti-parasitic pill designed to fight intestinal worms, which were a common affliction at the time. In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills. During the Second World War, it developed a new way of making penicillin, which was then seen as a miracle drug. After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine. During the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it invested heavily in R. & D., boosting its research budget to about twenty per cent of its sales. These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction). In 1999, when Pfizer celebrated its hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it was widely seen as the leading drug company in the world.\nPfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research. Since 2010, though, when Read took over as chief executive, it has cut its R. & D. budget significantly and raised its spending on stock buybacks. Under Read’s leadership,  cost-cutting  and financial engineering have sometimes seemed to be driving the company’s strategy. To some extent, these kinds of changes were unavoidable. As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.\nSo, like many other big American corporations, Pfizer is facing challenges adapting to a changed world. But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails. A venerable member of the Fortune 500 now looks for all the world like a greedy tax exile, skipping off to a dodgy foreign locale. (Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is  distinctly dodgy .)\nRead, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergan, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States. However, there is scant evidence that being based in the United States has handicapped Pfizer or made it more difficult for the company to raise capital.\nTo the contrary, being based in the United States enables Pfizer to exploit the vast reservoirs of technical expertise that reside here, and to access federal support for scientific research. For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health. And being headquartered in the United States certainly hasn’t prevented Pfizer from making a lot of money. Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.\nAll things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity. If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through. Its lead independent director is Dennis Ausiello, an eminent physician who, for many years, was chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other non-executives  on the Pfizer board  include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital. These directors are all experienced, worldly individuals. Last year, according to Pfizer’s 2015 proxy statement , they were each paid more than three hundred thousand dollars to carry out their duties, which include overseeing the company’s full-time management and protecting the long-term interests of all of its stakeholders: employees, shareholders, and customers.\nOne of those key interests, surely, is safeguarding Pfizer’s reputation, which has already suffered in recent years, following a big  marketing scandal  over the since-discontinued painkiller Bextra and other missteps. Read has for years been telling shareholders in his annual letter to them that “earning greater respect from society” is one of Pfizer’s strategic imperatives. One of the ways the company could do this, he said, was through “acting as a respectable corporate citizen.” So here is a question for the independent directors: Do you really think that traducing Pfizer’s proud history by moving to Dublin and shafting American taxpayers would be the act of a “respectable corporate citizen”?\nSign up for the daily newsletter.

3	1	Pfizer, Allergan considering a merger: DJ, citing sources	http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/pfizer-allegan-considering-a-merger-dj-citing-sources.html	Oct 29, 2015 ... Pfizer has held early talks with Allergan to discuss what could be the biggest \ntakeover deal this year, according to media reports.	3	\N	Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has held early talks with Botox-maker Allergan to discuss what could be the biggest takeover deal this year, The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported.\nThe healthcare sector has seen an unprecedented wave of deals since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers.\nA bid for Allergan, which has a market value of $113 billion, would be Pfizer's second recent attempt to acquire a big rival, following its unsuccessful courtship last year of Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca .\nCombining Allergan and Pfizer, which is worth $219 billion, would create the world's largest healthcare group with a market value of around $330 billion, ahead of Johnson & Johnson on $278 billion.\nA Pfizer spokesman said it "does not comment on market rumor and speculation." Allergan also declined to comment.\nThe potential for lowering Pfizer's tax bill by switching its headquarters from the United States to the United Kingdom was touted by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read as a key reason for the proposed AstraZeneca deal.\nA takeover of Allergan could offer similar advantages given that the Botox-maker is based in lower-tax Dublin. A U.S. attempt to crack down on such tax avoidance deals led to the collapse of AbbVie's bid to buy Shire , but it is unclear whether those rule changes would preclude potential tax advantages from a Pfizer-Allergan deal.\n"When you're the size of Pfizer, an acquisition like this may be the only choice you have in order to be able to move the needle for sequential growth...so the question now becomes, if not this, what, and if not now, when?" said WBB Securities' analyst Stephen Brozak.\nPfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, has also been suggested as a possible acquirer of GlaxoSmithKline and Shire, and shares in these two companies fell 1.5 and 1.8 percent on Thursday morning in London.\nRevenue boost\nMarket top? 2015 set to pass 2000 for M&A record\nBernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Allergan was a good fit and Pfizer might feel now was the right time to do a deal, given a recent market correction that has made Allergan look cheap.\nThe merger talks are in early stages, and may not yield an agreement, while other details are unclear, The Wall Street Journal said.\nThe Financial Times , which reported the talks later, described the talks as preliminary. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the reports.\nAllergan became the third-largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with Actavis in March.\nIts chief executive, Brent Saunders, has been eager to do deals, having first orchestrated the sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was initially CEO, to Actavis , then using the latter to seal the $66 billion purchase of Allergan.\nFollowing the Actavis tie-up, Allergan sold its generic drugs business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in July for $40.5 billion in cash and stock. And Saunders said after that he hoped to use those\nproceeds to do another large, "transformational" merger.\nIn its first full quarter after the Actavis deal, Allergan reported second-quarter revenue of $5.76 billion, led by $632 million in sales of wrinkle blocker Botox. Other top-selling drugs include dry eye treatment Restasis and Alzheimer's drug Namenda.\nPfizer recently reported third-quarter revenue of $12.1 billion, including $1.58 billion for its Prevnar pneumococcal vaccines and $947 million for pain drug Lyrica.\nWhile Pfizer wanted to buy AstraZeneca in part to boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs, a deal with Allergan would involve dermatology drugs and generics.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:11.207023-06

Credit Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\nWall Street has a late-in-the-week case of the Mondays.\nThe calendar says Thursday, but the bounty of deals announced today might make an investment banker think of Monday, the day when mega-mergers are usually unveiled.\nA day like today, when the value of deals outpaced the average “merger Monday,” might be called “transaction Thursday.”\nA pair of big deals helped the day stand out. Pfizer announced a $17 billion deal to acquire Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, and Rexam, the British aluminum can maker, said it was in talks to be acquired by Ball Corporation for about $8.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nBy DAVID GELLES and KATIE THOMAS\nIn its offer to buy Hospira, Pfizer is paying richly for what it believes will be a lucrative source of future revenue, drugs known as biosimilars.\nThe bid by Ball values Rexam at about $6.5 billion and would combine two of the world’s largest makers of beverage cans, whose customers include giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.\nA third big deal also was in the headlines today — the British telecommunications company BT said it had agreed to buy the mobile operator EE for $18.6 billion — but Thomson Reuters recorded that on an earlier date, when the two companies announced they were in talks.\nThe former British telecom monopoly agreed on Thursday to buy EE, Britain’s largest cellphone network, from Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany.\nIn total, according to the Thomson Reuters data, $25.7 billion of deals were recorded on Thursday.\nThat is significantly above average for this day of the week. Since early 2011, an average of $9 billion of deals were announced on Thursday, the data shows.\nAnd it’s even above the average value of Monday deals since 2011, which is $17.5 billion, according to the data.\nIn general, Monday beats Thursday by almost 2 to 1. Wall Street’s bankers are accustomed to using the weekend to put the finishing touches on deals before they are announced. An aggregate total of $3.7 trillion of deals have been announced on Monday since early 2011, compared with $1.9 trillion on Thursday.\nThe biggest “transaction Thursday” since 2011 came on Feb. 13, 2014, when $75.2 billion of deals were announced, a level that would be impressive even on a Monday.\nOn that day, Comcast announced a deal to buy Time Warner Cable for more than $45 billion in stock. That transaction has yet to close, and investors appear to be nervous about its prospects.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:11.243122-06

What made both companies especially appealing are their offshore addresses, which would allow Pfizer to benefit from lower corporate tax rates, potentially saving millions in U.S. taxes.\nThe $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan deal instantly turned the combined company, Pfizer Plc, into the world's largest drug maker. The windfall tax savings will likely give the new Pfizer a big competitive advantage against major U.S.-based drug firms with thousands of employees, such as Merck & Co., Eli Lilly and Company and Johnson & Johnson. What it will not do, experts say, is ramp up the development of innovative new drugs for consumers.\nThat's because the companies' research portfolios are so different. "The fields in which they're operating don't overlap much," says David Collis, of Harvard Business School. "Will putting these two companies together produce a better company than can deliver more and better drugs to more people? That's hard to see."\nIt will likely spur other mergers and acquisitions—possibly making AstraZenica an even more alluring target. Companies that once focused on developing drugs in-house will adopt Pfizer's model of finding attractive companies with promising drugs and buying them up. "I think it will increase the cost of health care," says Dr. Donald Conway, of the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College.\nDespite Pfizer's $7 billion to $8 billion investment in innovative drug research, Conway says, the company's drug development pipeline has been relatively weak. Viagra, the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug, emerged by chance, after subjects who took the drug as part of a failed pulmonary hypertension trial asked if they could continue to get it, he says.\n"They have not come up with great products," Conway says. "Viagra was serendipity. They stumbled into a market that didn't exist before they got there."\nFor much of its recent history, Pfizer's monumental success stems from astute mergers and acquisitions, including Warner-Lambert; Pharmacia, along with its blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex; Wyeth; and now Allergan, the maker of Botox, with a promising research and development pipeline, focusing mainly on eye-care, neuroscience, dermatology and gastrointestinal illnesses.\n"Pfizer is expert at first partnering with someone and then having a good, solid team of business analysts estimate what the asset is really worth. Then they buy the company. That's what happened with Celebrex ," Conway says. "G.D. Searle held the intellectual property. Searle merged with Pharmacia and Pfizer bought Pharmacia."\nIn an early-morning call with investors Monday, officers of the two drug-makers portrayed their deal as a boon for health care. Pfizer trumpeted Allergan's strength in drug classes Pfizer had "exited" due to weak returns. The new Pfizer inherits Allergan's pipeline of more than 70 experimental drugs, which includes a new line of biosimilars--essentially me-too versions of existing biotech drugs, says Mahud Hassan, director of the pharmaceutical management program at Rutgers University.\nThese drugs take advantage of existing biotech markets, Hassan says, though their profit margin is significantly smaller than standard generic drugs, which don't require biotechnology to produce.\nFor its part, Allergan cited quick access to Pfizer's global markets. And both firms are likely to benefit from operating synergies that will allow both to cut costs and likely trim back their workforces.\nThe tax savings give Pfizer a big competitive edge, because they free up cash to do other deals, such as buying small but innovative biotech or pharma companies.\nPfizer officials said that the relocated firm would have an effective tax rate of 18 percent in the first year after the deal closes, far less than the 25 percent rate the Pfizer now pays. The lower tax rates would free up billions of dollars trapped overseas giving Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," CEO Ian Read told participants on the call.\nPfizer will make the most of that money, Conway says. "Pfizer's analysts are expert at assessing an asset before they jump. They do a lot of jumping. They do it intelligently. And now they have a tax advantage to acquire smaller companies because they're competing at a more favorable tax rate."	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:12.300843-06

14	1	The Pfizer-Allergan Merger: From Serial Acquirer to Serial Offender ...	http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/12/03/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-from-serial-acquirer-to.aspx	5 days ago ... Pfizer is giving away too much to Allergan shareholders in order to carry out their \ntax-advantaged merger.	14	\N	The Pfizer-Allergan Merger: From Serial Acquirer to Serial Offender\nPfizer is giving away too much to Allergan shareholders in order to carry out their tax-advantaged merger.\nDec 3, 2015 at 2:07PM\nU.S. stocks are lower on Thursday afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) down 1.14% and down 1.25%, respectively, at 1 p.m. ET. Shares of pharmaceuticals  Pfizer and Allergan PLC are displaying similar losses (down 0.94% and 1.38%, respectively).\nLeerink Partners, an investment bank specializing in the healthcare sector, published a report on Tuesday that looks at which of Pfizer's or Allergan's shareholders are getting the better deal in their proposed $160 billion tie-up. Their conclusion ought to stoke concerns about the merits of the deal for Pfizer's owners.\nLeerink puts the value of the post-merger company at $37 to $38 per share based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, which is right in line with the company's $37 price target. According to the analyst, this suggests "most of the near-term value captured by the deal is going to AGN [Allergan] shareholders."\nIn pursuing Allergan, Pfizer was manifestly motivated to complete a deal that would enable it to transfer its domicile to a lower tax jurisdiction (a so-called "corporate inversion"). There was a very short list of potential targets large enough to ensure that Pfizer shareholders end up with fewer than 60% of the shares of the new company, a requirement in order to achieve the optimal tax treatment.\nThe circle narrows Roughly speaking, using today's market capitalization for Pfizer and excluding the value of synergies, the target would need to be worth at least $134 billion. As of today, there are only six pharmaceutical companies in the world other than Pfizer that meet that criterion. Actually, with a market value of $124 billion, Allergan doesn't meet that criterion today (don't forget those synergies, though!).\nThe list of targets got shorter in May, when Pfizer abandoned its proposed $118 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca plc this year, a deal that offered the same benefit. (The current proposed deal has Pfizer shareholders owning roughly 56% of the combined company.)\nPfizer's single-minded ambition to carry out an inversion has forced management to take their eyes off other key considerations in assessing the attractiveness of a mega-deal.\nFrom serial acquirer to serial offender It was not always thus. This column has previously referred to the Boston Consulting Group's 2004 report, Growing Through Acquisitions: The Successful Acquisition Record of Acquisitive Growth Strategies , which identifies Pfizer as a model of the successful acquirer, writing that "Pfizer is perhaps the most dramatic example in the pharmaceutical industry of a company that has built a strong competitive position and substantial shareholder value, at least in part by means of aggressive acquisition."\nA successful acquisition-driven growth strategy ultimately sows the seeds of its failure, as the acquiring company is forced to pursue larger and larger targets to sustain it. At some point, the size imperative crowds out other considerations in evaluating potential transactions. In other words, size matters...too much. That was the case with the $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, and history is at risk of repeating itself with this latest deal.\nThe $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known "Social Security secrets" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

I know ...	16	\N	The Pfizer-Allergan merger is good for the US – if you're in the 1%\nIf tax inversion deals like Pfizer’s continue, they seem likely to reinforce and even exacerbate existing economic inequality\nThe Pfizer World Headquarters in New York City on Tuesday. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton be damned! The Pfizer-Allergan merger – let’s call it “Pfallergan” – is good for America. Really it is. I know this, because Ian Read, Pfizer’s Scotland-born CEO, has told me so.\nRead’s argument might seem a bit of stretch. Assuming the record $155bn merger/tax inversion is completed as envisaged, Pfizer won’t be a US corporation any longer. Some $21bn in tax revenues it once generated for the United States might evaporate. Instead, a smaller portion will flow to the Irish government’s coffers, since “Pfallergan” will pay corporate tax there at a rate of 17% or 18%, instead of the 25% or so that it pays to the United States today. Those savings, Read insisted, will make it possible for Pfallergan to create more jobs in the United States and to reinvest its retained profits in new ventures.\nWhat’s not to like? Well Clinton and Sanders don’t like it for a start. Sanders has called the deal “a disaster for Americans”.\nNow the future of tax inversion deals - in which one company acquires another in a more attractive tax jurisdiction to escape the US corporate tax code – may hinge on whether politicians and the public can swallow Read’s argument or our those of our Democrat hopefuls.\nRead is making the case that the merger is actually about finding more resources “ to cure major illnesses for humanity ”. Of course, it’s also about generating more profits for Pfizer’s investors.\nAsk any M&A advisor, and they’ll tell you – vehemently – that one of the single largest factors affecting the financial success of a merger deal is the company’s tax rate. The lower it is, the higher the returns for shareholders; the easier it will be to absorb small hiccups and costs of integrating the two companies.\nAdd to that the peculiar set of circumstances facing US companies, and you’ve got a reasonable argument that the current status quo is almost driving CEOs like Read into the arms of overseas partners.\nWhether or not political critics like it, the corporate tax rate in the United States – as high as 35% – is higher than that in many other OECD nations. The icing on the cake is that the United States is virtually alone in taxing global income by its companies (its non-resident citizens). That has left companies with big foreign “cash mountains” in foreign subsidiaries that they are reluctant to repatriate and subject to what they view as hefty (translation: out of line with the rates charged by other nations) US taxes.\nIt was this latter consideration that drove Medtronic Inc to merge with Dublin-based Covidien at the beginning of this year in what was – at $49.9bn – then the largest tax inversion on record. Ironically, that particular transaction wasn’t even good for Medtronic’s shareholders, who got stuck with a big tax bill on capital gains related to the structure of the transaction.\nThe announcement of Pfallergan’s proposed creation accomplished the miracle of uniting (briefly) some politicians from both major US political parties in hostility to the transaction . Clinton blasted the deal, saying Pfizer is trying to wiggle out of paying its fair share of taxes and the merger “will leave US taxpayers holding the bag”. Republican Donald Trump was equally scathing, calling the inversion “disgusting”.\nThe initial reaction by Pfizer investors wasn’t that much more rapturous. Immediately after the announcement on Monday, Pfizer’s shares dropped 2.6% to trade at $31.33, while Allergan (technically the acquirer) saw its stock drop 3.4% to $301.72 a share, trading at 17% below the price that Allergan investors will get for their stock in the transaction (which already was a 30% premium above the price where the shares had traded before word of the negotiations first became public).\nFor the most part, that discount signals the riskiness of the transaction , given that the two companies are going to be trying to win the needed regulatory approvals during the height of the always-tumultuous presidential election season. The Treasury Department’s introduction of new measures to make the inversions more difficult may have ramifications for the deal\nThe Pfizer transaction makes the last estimate by Congress’s joint committee on taxation – that inversions will cost US taxpayers $19.5bn over the 10 years to 2014 – look hopelessly inadequate. As a result the question of inversion is almost guaranteed to emerge as a political hot potato in the presidential election season. With every month that passes, more and more household names have moved their headquarters abroad: Burger King pays its taxes to Canada; Chiquita Brands to Ireland.\nThe problem is that while CEOs are very, very clear about what they need to do to serve their constituency – cut how much they pay in corporate taxes, in order to maximize what they can reinvest in their businesses and distribute to their shareholders in the form of dividends, buybacks or other initiatives – politicians, in spite of their united opposition to inversions, can’t agree on how to tackle them.\nIdeally, the problem would be solved by a complete overhaul of the tax code. But how likely is that to happen, given the complete inability of Democrats and Republicans to agree even on basic priorities and guidelines, and the fact that Congress only narrowly avoids complete government shutdowns over more minor issues?\nThat leaves – for now – the Treasury Department and other bodies trying to pass rules to limit these inversions by trying to make them less financially appealing. The fact that the Pfizer transaction was announced in the wake of some of those seems to signal that CEOs still find them too lucrative to avoid.\nAnd that, in turn, raises a much broader dilemma for politicians. A CEO might argue that it doesn’t matter if taxpayers suffer a bit from the loss of corporate tax revenue, because those taxpayers also are investors, and they’ll benefit financially from that side of the transaction. Except that half of all Americans don’t invest in the stock market at all , even via mutual funds in 401(k) plans or other retirement vehicles, with half of those saying they don’t do so because they can’t afford to do so.\nIn other words, to the extent that tax inversions continue, they seem likely to reinforce and even exacerbate existing economic inequality. The burden created by the loss of corporate tax revenue would hit all taxpayers, but any benefits would flow disproportionately to those who possess the disposable income to invest. That’s precisely the same kind of pattern that we saw take shape beginning in the recovery from the financial and economic crisis in 2009, when 95% of the subsequent growth was captured by the wealthiest 1% of Americans .\nIt’s that issue that everyone should bear in mind when pondering what to do next. Because as long as the disparity between corporate tax rates in the United States and other developed countries exists, there’s going to be an incentive for other CEOs to do precisely what Pfizer’s Read just did: it’s as enticing as a laser pointer is to your new kitten. Either an outright ban or a new tax code would require Congressional action, and anything else will be ineffective. Given that presidential candidates have plans and proposals addressing absolutely anything you’d care to mention, inversions included, maybe it’s time to go a step further and grill the presidential candidates not on what they propose to do, but on how they plan to do it, and what steps they’ll take to get it through Congress. Or admit that we’ll just see more “Pfallergans”.\nThis discussion is closed for comments.\nWe’re doing some maintenance right now. You can still read comments, but please come back later to add your own.\nCommenting has been disabled for this account ( why? )	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:12.320581-06

The Scottish-born chief executive of Pfizer, Ian C.

Read, told them that a merger with Allergan, the maker of Botox that is based in Dublin, would significantly cut Pfizer’s tax bill and give it more cash that it could invest in the United States and ultimately add jobs, according to people briefed on the calls. He made the calls in recent days as the two companies were hammering out a $152 billion deal .\nMonday’s announcement of the deal — the biggest merger in 15 years — has revived a fierce public debate over whether mergers that allow a company in the United States to relocate to a lower-tax country are, in fact, good for America.\nPfizer, founded by German immigrants in Brooklyn in 1849, is becoming the biggest company yet to shed its American citizenship to lower its taxes. While not structured as what is known as an inversion, it achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad. Continue reading the main story\nRecord Year of Deal-Making\nGiant impending deals announced this year include:\nAn aborted bid by Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca of Britain in an inversion last year set off a public uproar — leading President Obama to call such deals “unpatriotic” — and prompted moves by the Treasury to curb them.\nThe latest merger announcement has stirred a similar outcry across the political spectrum.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nDonald J. Trump, a Republican candidate for president, said in a statement: “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting. Our politicians should be ashamed.”\nYet the two companies and their advisers are betting that the Treasury Department will not be able to come up with new rules to block the union, and that Congress will fail to revamp the tax code before the merger’s expected close late next year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnd as Mr. Read has made clear publicly and privately, his main priority is doing well by his shareholders — and that means finding a way to compete with huge foreign rivals that enjoy much lower tax rates.\n“We’ve assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of the patients and to bring value to shareholders,” Mr. Read said on Monday on a call with analysts. “That is our obligation.”\nMr. Read and those close to him have noted that Pfizer, based in New York, has been upfront about its intentions. Even after its takeover campaign for AstraZeneca collapsed, the Pfizer chief made no secret of his desire to try again, while criticizing a tax code that he said leaves his company fighting with one hand tied behind its back.\nThe drug maker, which manufactured penicillin during World War II, has complained that its tax rate last year was 26 percent, compared with the approximately 5 percent that Allergan’s predecessor company paid during that same time.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBigger international rivals, from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of Britain to Novartis of Switzerland, also pay substantially less in taxes, potentially letting them win takeover contests with higher bids.\nPerhaps more important, Pfizer kept overseas $74 billion in profits that were earned abroad last year, because bringing them home would have racked up billions of dollars in taxes.\nSince the AstraZeneca bid, the Obama administration has introduced new rules that have made it harder for companies to do inversion deals, scuttling efforts by companies like AbbVie , a large drug maker based in Illinois, to relocate abroad.\nFrom the beginning of their deal discussions nearly three months ago, Pfizer and Allergan agreed that the best way forward was to forgo an inversion altogether, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Instead, Allergan would serve as the buyer despite being substantially smaller.\nMindful of the sensitivity in Washington, Pfizer included in its advisory team the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company, whose vice chairman is Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.\nWhile Mr. Cantor will not lobby lawmakers, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, he has advised the company on political aspects of the deal and maintains friendly contact with his former colleagues.\nDespite the political uproar, the merger is not expected to encounter significant resistance from the American regulator that will review the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the people with direct knowledge of the deal.\nA spokesman for the Treasury Department said on Monday that it did not comment on specific transactions. Still, the department has clearly signaled its distaste for deals that move a company’s tax home.\nThe particular design of Monday’s transaction, however, effectively shields Pfizer and Allergan from the administration’s efforts to curb such deals. Continue reading the main story\nRelated Tax Inversion Coverage\nWhen the Treasury Department announced its latest rule changes on Thursday, advisers to both companies sat down to review the changes — and quickly went back to work on their negotiations, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n“Treasury’s proposals don’t touch them,” said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant who examined the deal.\nPresidential candidates offered swift condemnation of the transaction all the same.\nSuch transactions, Mrs. Clinton said, “take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system.”\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.”\nYet others said a broader tax overhaul was needed.\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the news of the merger “only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive nature of the U.S. tax code.”\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nExecutives at both Pfizer and Allergan are betting that Congress will continue to be conflicted about how to deal with inversions. Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have called for a comprehensive regulatory overhaul and have shown reluctance to focus on particular companies.\n“It’s not clear what Washington’s wishes are,” said one person close to the transaction. “We tried to tell them to fix our tax system. It’s not like this is a surprise.”\nAt the same time, both Mr. Read and his counterpart at Allergan, Brenton L. Saunders, have emphasized that the deal isn’t being done just to cut taxes.\nBoth executives contend the deal gives Pfizer access to fast-growing treatments in the eye care and dermatology space, as well as brands like Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm.\nMoreover, it will give Pfizer enough size and product diversity to break itself up in three years’ time, dividing itself into a company focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another built on more mature treatments that face competition from generic competitors. The company said on Monday that it would decide in late 2018 whether to proceed with a split.\nBuying Allergan will bring more fast-growing treatments to Pfizer’s portfolio. That would complement Pfizer’s $17 billion acquisition of the generic drug maker Hospira earlier this year, meant to bulk up its so-called established treatments division.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Pfizer would essentially pay $363.63 for each Allergan share, representing a nearly 30 percent premium to Allergan’s share price in late October before news emerged that they were in talks. That values the acquisition at $152 billion. Including debt and subtracting cash, the deal is worth $160 billion.\nAfter the transaction, Pfizer shareholders are expected to own about 56 percent of the combined company, with the remaining 44 percent owned by Allergan shareholders. Mr. Read will be chief executive of the new Pfizer P.L.C., to be based in Dublin, while Mr. Saunders will become president, and will be in line to take over one of the company’s businesses if and when it decides to break itself up.\nInvestors appeared unimpressed. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent, while Pfizer’s ended down 2.6 percent.\nThe expected cost savings of about $2 billion over the first three years announced after the deal was made were well below most analysts’ projections. And the $5 billion in planned stock buybacks that also were announced on Monday were in line with Pfizer’s previous efforts.\nSome analysts still regarded the deal positively, so far as it ties into Pfizer’s goals.\n“Allergan was easier to get done as a friendly deal in terms of getting a structure done and management roles done,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies.\nTo some involved in the deal, the tax savings are all that matters. “If the tax stuff went away entirely, the deal would be off,” a person briefed on Mr. Read’s thinking said.\nLiz Moyer, Chad Bray and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.\nA version of this article appears in print on November 24, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Chief of Pfizer Defends Merger as Good for U.S. Order Reprints | Today's Paper | Subscribe	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:12.326413-06

We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nClinton went on to say that she would soon be rolling out specific plans to prevent inversions and to close other loopholes in the tax code so firms can’t “game the international tax system.” She added that she wants Congress to act immediately to make sure that large corporations pay their “fair share” and called on regulators to “look hard at stronger actions they can take.”\nThe U.S. has in recent years seen a growth in the number of tax inversions, in which an American company buys a foreign one and officially moves abroad to take advantage of a foreign country’s lower tax rate, even while leaving its headquarters and operations back in the U.S.\nRELATED:  Competitor to offer $1 pill after Turing price hike outrage\nBurger King and Fruit of the Loom are some of the better known brands to legally move abroad, but pharmaceutical firms have been among the most aggressive in exploiting the move.\nSanders said the Pfizer-Allergan deal would be “disaster” and called on the Obama administration to stop the merger, which would create the largest drug-maker in the world. “The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said in a statement.\n“The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.

Pfizer investors will get one share of the new company for each of their shares or a portion of payment in cash from a $6 billion to $12 billion payment that will be made as part of the merger.\nThe transaction is currently valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of roughly $160 billion, including debt, based on the $32.18 per share closing price of Pfizer stock on Nov. 20, the companies said.\nThe deal terms call for the companies to combine under Allergan, which will be renamed Pfizer and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the PFE ticker symbol. The new combination would retain Allergan's legal and tax residency in Ireland. Pfizer would have its global operational headquarters in New York and its principal executive offices in Ireland.\nIan Read, Pfizer's CEO and chairman, will hold both those roles in the newly combined company. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will serve as president and chief operating officer of the new company.\nAdditionally, Pfizer's board is expected to have 15 directors, including all of Pfizer's 11 current directors and four current directors from Allergan.\nAs a result of the transaction, Pfizer said it plans to make a decision about a possible separation of the combined company's innovative and established operations into separate firms by the end of 2018.\nThe agreement is expected to face regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, and shareholders of both companies must vote on the transaction. Company officials said they expect the deal to close in the second half of 2016.\nThe agreement comes four days after the Obama administration stepped up its attack on corporate tax inversions — transactions in which a U.S. company reincorporates in a lower tax nation in a bid to cut its future tax bills while its leaving domestic operations in place.\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the restrictions, the second targeting inversions since 2014, were aimed at preventing inversions from eroding the nation's federal tax base. Congressional Democrats have generally backed the White House position. Republicans have said inversions should be addressed as part of a broader federal tax reform to lower the 39% U.S. top tax rate on business, the world's highest levy.\nPfizer officials predicted the Pfizer-Allergan combination would have an effective tax rate of 17% to 18% starting in the first year after the deal closes — well below the 25% rate the U.S. firm currently reports in financial filings.\nRead also said the deal would give Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," a reference to billions of dollars the company holds overseas because shifting the money to the U.S. would subject the funds to a substantial federal tax bite.\nHowever, the Treasury rules are not expected to affect the merger, in part because the transaction is structured to have Dublin-based Allergan, with a market capitalization of roughly $122 billion, acquire New York City-headquartered Pfizer, which has a market capitalization of approximately $200 billion.\nAllergan shareholders would hold an estimated 44% of the newly combined company's shares, with Pfizer investors holding 56%, company officials said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts. The level of Pfizer ownership falls below the 60% legal threshold needed for the deal to be officially deemed a tax inversion under the federal tax code and considered subject to the Treasury rules, said independent tax expert Robert Willens.\nTreasury officials declined to comment on the merger.\nRead pointedly referenced business industry and political discussions about the inversion issue and the wider question of federal tax reform as he and other Pfizer and Allergan officials fielded questions from financial analysts.\n"While reform progresses, we've assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of patients and to bring value to shareholders," said Read. "That is our obligation."\nSpeaking more generally about the merger, he said the agreement would facilitate discovery and development of new medications for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continue investments in the U.S.\nSaunders characterized the deal as a "highly strategic, value-enhancing transaction" and said it would give Allergan new or increased access to dozens of markets, including Japan and China.\n2434 CONNECT TWEET 301 LINKEDIN 123 COMMENT EMAIL MORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1jfM6qI	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:12.295265-06

Pfizer Inc. and Allergan Plc are moving toward a plan to make Brent Saunders ... \nwhose name Actavis took after their 2014 merger agreement.	15	\N	Pfizer, Allergan Said to Discuss Making Saunders CEO in Deal\nEventual split would give Saunders faster-growing business\nPfizer Inc. and Allergan Plc are moving toward a plan to make Brent Saunders chief executive officer if the two drug giants reach a takeover agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.\nA combined Pfizer and Allergan would probably split into two companies eventually, with Allergan CEO Saunders taking the helm of the faster-growing business of new brand-name drugs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are private. The other unit would contain older products at or near the end of their patent lives.\nThe largest U.S. drugmaker said last month it was in “preliminary friendly discussions” about combining with Allergan. An acquisition of Allergan, which is incorporated in Dublin and run from New Jersey, would give Pfizer a low-tax legal address abroad and valuable drugs like the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment. The companies could agree on a deal by Thanksgiving, celebrated in the U.S. on Nov. 26, people familiar with the matter said last week.\nPfizer is led by Ian Read, 62, who has been CEO since 2010. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion and Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur declined to comment.\nThe idea of a Pfizer breakup was popularized in 2012, when a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested that the company might be worth more in pieces than as a whole. Since then, whether or not the company would pull the lever to do so has been the subject of constant speculation, though Pfizer has said it couldn’t happen until at least 2017. Allergan itself is in the process of a split under Saunders’s leadership, after agreeing in July to sell its generics business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nSaunders, 45, spent his first dozen years in the health-care industry largely in compliance positions. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and the Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, he became a CEO for the first time in 2010 with Bausch & Lomb Inc. Three years later he sold the eye-care company to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. for $8.7 billion.\nAfter Bausch & Lomb, activist investor Carl Icahn endorsed Saunders becoming CEO of Forest Laboratories Inc. Soon after, Actavis Plc bought Forest and Saunders became CEO of the combined entity, with the acquirer’s chief executive Paul Bisaro assuming the role of executive chairman. They both remain in place at Allergan, whose name Actavis took after their 2014 merger agreement.\nRead took the helm at Pfizer after a turbulent period for the drugmaker that ended with the ouster of CEO Jeff Kindler. A chemical engineer by training, he joined Pfizer in 1978 as an accountant, then rose through the drugmaker’s ranks to run its worldwide pharmaceutical businesses. Since Dec. 5, 2010, when Read was named CEO, the stock has doubled from $16.72 to more than $33.\nSince taking over, he has overhauled the company’s R&D operations, cutting struggling programs like allergy and respiratory drugs to focus on cancer, neurology, inflammation, vaccines and immunology.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:12.315914-06

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Hospira, Inc.\n“We are pleased that Hospira, the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, is now part of Pfizer. We want to welcome our new Hospira colleagues to Pfizer. We are excited to add their talents and proud of the shared commitment of all Pfizer colleagues to serving patients worldwide,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. “We believe that through this transaction, we’ve created value for our shareholders by delivering incremental revenue and expected EPS growth in the near-term by strengthening our GEP business and positioning it for future growth.”\nPfizer’s GEP business now has a leadership position in the large and growing sterile injectables category, with a robust portfolio of both generic and branded products. The global market for generic sterile injectables is estimated to be $70 billion in 2020. In addition, GEP has significantly advanced its biosimilars business with a broadened portfolio of marketed products and pipeline assets, which will benefit from Pfizer’s best-in-class capabilities in monoclonal antibody development and manufacturing. The global market for biosimilars is estimated to be approximately $20 billion in 2020.

Pfizer is now poised to use its commercial capabilities, global scale, scientific expertise and manufacturing prowess, which now includes two of the largest sterile injectable manufacturing facilities in the world, to maximize the global potential of its enhanced GEP portfolio of sterile injectables, biosimilars and medication management systems.\n“Pfizer and Hospira are now one unified team providing patients with access to one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios of difficult-to-manufacture, life-saving sterile injectable products in the industry. Together, we are also a leading global biosimilars company with a robust pipeline, best-in-class development capabilities and extensive real-world commercialization experience. We can also deliver novel capabilities through our medication management systems business,” said John Young, group president, Global Established Pharmaceutical business. “By increasing the number and availability of high-quality generic injectable drugs and biosimilars that we offer our customers, we are strengthening our commitment to improving the health and quality of life of patients around the world with high quality medicines across key therapeutic areas.”\nPfizer continues to expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to adjusted diluted EPS 1  upon closing, and accretive by $0.10 - $0.12 per share in the first full year after the close, with additional accretion anticipated thereafter. In addition, Pfizer expects the transaction will deliver $800 million in annual cost synergies by 2018. Pfizer intends to update its 2015 financial guidance in the coming weeks to incorporate Hospira. The guidance will reflect the anticipated contribution from Hospira operations from the time of the completion of the Hospira merger to Pfizer's fiscal year end, which is November 30, 2015 for Pfizer’s international fiscal year and December 31, 2015 for Pfizer’s U.S. fiscal year.\nHospira, Inc. is now a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps.\nInformation for Hospira Shareholders\nOn September 3, 2015, Hospira’s common stock ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and former Hospira shareholders became entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $90 in cash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) for each share of Hospira common stock they owned as of September 3, 2015.\nFor Hospira registered shareholders, Pfizer has appointed Computershare Trust Company N.A. as paying agent for payment of the merger consideration.

Johnson November 23 Follow @carolynyjohnson\nAllergan's $160 billion purchase of Pfizer gives it a lineup of fast growing drugs and a lower tax rate. The merger will create the world's largest drug maker in a controversial inversion deal. (Reuters)\nPfizer and Allergan on Monday morning announced they would merge in a massive, $160 billion deal that will create the world's largest drugmaker, producing treatments as varied as Lipitor and Botox.\nThe deal is structured as a reverse merger, with smaller Dublin-based Allergan buying New York-based Pfizer, and it is likely to renew concerns over "inversions," where U.S. companies are bought by or merge with foreign firms in order to reduce U.S. corporate tax burdens. In a press release, Pfizer said the combined company would generate more than $2 billion in savings over the first three years and would enjoy a tax rate of 17 to 18 percent -- far less than Pfizer's current corporate tax rate of 25 percent.\nJust days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department issued rules seeking to crack down on these types of deals, which President Obama has labeled " unpatriotic ."\n[ Pfizer-Allergan merger shows why it's so hard to stop tax-dodging companies ]\nLast year, several such inversion deals fell apart and sparked scrutiny of corporate tax loopholes. In October 2014, Chicago-based AbbVie and Dublin-based Shire  called off a $54 billion inversion deal after the Treasury issued new rules . That same month, Raleigh, N.C.-based Salix Pharmaceuticals and the Italian firm, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA terminated a reverse merger , citing changes in the political environment.\nIn a call with analysts, Pfizer chief executive Ian Read said that Pfizer appreciates the attention to inversions from politicians, presidential candidates, and Treasury but decided to proceed.\n"On the political risk, we've assessed this deal looking at the present regulations, the new notices, and all the information we can glean, and we believe this deal is a great deal for shareholders, both of Allergan and Pfizer," Read said.\nAs measured by annual revenue, Pfizer is more than twice the size of Allergan -- Pfizer reported $49.6 billion in revenues in 2014 , while Allergan, which recently merged with Actavis , projected a combined $23 billion in revenues for 2015. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and create a combined company with an operating cash flow of more than $25 billion by 2018. Current Allergan shareholders will own 44 percent of the combined company, while Pfizer shareholders will own 56 percent -- a careful division of ownership that is structured to avoid triggering additional taxes. Federal rules subject inverted companies to more taxes if the shareholders of the U.S. company own at least 60 percent of the shares.\nGustav Ando, research director for IHS Life Sciences, a business information and consulting company, said that he thought the deal was carefully structured and likely to be approved, but added that it may receive even more scrutiny due to the current public and political outrage over high drug prices for the pharmaceutical industry.\n"This merger isn’t meant to benefit patients; it isn’t meant to innovate in any kind of way. It’s basically a tax inversion strategy, and certainly the benefits won’t be passed on to consumers," Ando said. "It's pretty easy at the moment to paint the pharmaceutical industry in a negative light and this certainly doesn’t do anything to help the cause. It definitely increases the reputational risks to the industry."\n[Read more:  Specialty drugs now cost more than the median household income ]\nThe combined company, which will be called Pfizer plc, will bring together a huge U.S. pharmaceutical company best known for iconic drugs like the cholesterol-fighting Lipitor and erectile dysfunction medication Viagra with Allergan, which is best known for making wrinkle-smoothing Botox.\nAllergan is technically buying Pfizer due to the structure of the deal. Before the merger, Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each share they own. Pfizer stockholders will receive one share for each share they own. The new company will be combined under Allergan plc, which will then rename itself Pfizer plc. The company will maintain its global headquarters in New York, but its key executive offices will be in Ireland, the statement said.\nIn a letter to Sen. Mitch McConnell, Pfizer's chief executive, Read, reiterated the combined company's deep commitment to the U.S., noting that when the deal is expected to close there will be 40,000 employees spread across 25 states.\n"We believe this will be good for patients and for U.S. competitiveness," Read wrote to McConnell.\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders both put out statements denouncing the deal.\n"This proposed merger, and so-called ‘inversions’ by other companies, will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag," Clinton said. "As President, I will fight to reform our tax system to reward growth, innovation, and job creation here in the United States. "\nSanders said the merger would be punishing for consumers in America who already pay higher prices for prescription drugs than the rest of the world.\n"The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority," Sanders said.\nWhile the merger will create a behemoth pharmaceutical company, most industry watchers expect the growth to precede a major split in which Pfizer will spin off its business into two separate companies. One company is expected to focus on research and development of new, innovative drugs, and the other will focus on the pipeline of generic products.\n"Probably, the company will now be splitting itself up. That’s the part of the strategy," said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School. "They’re pretty clear about it -- it’s bulking up in order to slim down."\nAndo noted that follows a larger trend in the pharmaceutical industry, in which pharmaceutical companies that have grown or acquired different lines of business spin off companies, too. For example, Baxter International Inc. this year spun off its biopharmaceutical drug business into a separate company, Baxalta.\nDimitri Drone, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that buying and selling has become the "new normal" in the pharmaceutical industry, with companies buying up others and also splitting off specific parts of the business.\n"Joining forces with Pfizer matches our leading products in seven high growth therapeutic areas and our robust R&D pipeline with Pfizer’s leading innovative and established businesses, vast global footprint and strength in discovery and development research to create a new biopharma leader," Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said in a statement.\nMore from Wonkblog:\nCarolyn Johnson is a reporter covering the business of health.

On Thursday, Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc confirmed that they are in discussions \nabout a potential acquisition that could be the industry's largest ...	21	\N	On Thursday, Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc confirmed that they are in discussions about a potential acquisition that could be the industry’s largest in history. Pharmaceutical companies set a new record for the value of deals struck in the first half of 2015, and executives and analysts don’t expect the fever to fade. Getty/Spencer Platt\nPharmaceutical companies are striking deals at a dizzying rate. The collective value of 2015’s deals is on pace to break the previous record, which was set only last year. Analysts and industry experts say this fervor is a product of shifts in the industry’s competitive landscape and executives’ acquired taste for more focused and streamlined business models, even at the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies.\nIn the latest round of negotiations, the Wall Street Journal reported  Thursday that Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc have begun talks about an acquisition that could be the industry’s largest in history given Allergan’s market cap of $113 billion. Allergan confirmed the companies were in “preliminary friendly discussions” in a statement posted to its website.\nThe announcement comes even while Allergan completes the sale of its generics unit to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in a $40.5 billion deal announced just three months ago. Pfizer kicked off 2015 by announcing that it would buy Hospira Inc., which produces injectable drugs and biosimilars, for $17 billion. If this latest purchase is also completed, Pfizer will welcome brand name specialty drugs including anti-wrinkle Botox injections and Namenda for dementia to its already-expanding portfolio. \nSuch fondness for acquisitions reflects the rapid growth of deals taking place across the pharmaceutical industry this year. In the first half of 2015, pharmaceutical companies struck $211.7 billion worth of deals compared with $205.4 billion in the first half of 2014, which wound up being a record year in both the volume and value of agreements.\nTo some degree, this trend fuels itself. “I think you just get a little bit of a feeding frenzy going on,” Max Jacobs, a biotech analyst at Edison Investment Research , says. “You're worried that the companies you would ideally like to take over in two to three years might be taken over so you have to get them now.”\nBut groupthink isn't the only factor at play.  Mergermarket reports that pharmaceutical executives say the single largest driver for recent deals is to reduce costs through operational efficiency and to seek a lower tax rate in countries other than the U.S. If the Pfizer-Allergan purchase proceeds, Pfizer could claim Allergan’s Dublin headquarters as its own and save the company millions of dollars a year in corporate taxes. Ireland’s tax rate only charges companies 12.5 percent of profits. The U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate of any country, and companies in the U.S. can pay up to 40 percent in some states.\n“If they became an Irish-organized company, the taxes could easily go down to half of what they are today,” Albert Wertheimer , a pharmaco-economic expert at Temple University, says. \nMany of Pfizer’s competitors have completed so-called tax inversion deals in recent years, and CEO Ian Read said on Thursday at a Wall Street Journal event that he thinks the New York City-based drugmaker is suffering as a result. “I feel we are at a tremendous disadvantage right now in that race,” he said.\nIn addition to earning a more favorable tax code, large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focusing resources on a few key areas rather than spreading themselves across specialties ranging from animal health to cosmetics. Increasingly, management teams are choosing to become the best company in two or three areas such as cancer or neurological disorders, rather than funding research teams that try to find breakthrough treatments for every disease at once. Jamie Davies , head of healthcare and pharmaceutical analysis at BMI Research, says this “de-diversification” is another factor fueling the current deal-making frenzy.\nPfizer is among the companies that have adopted this strategy. Read has even said the company is considering splitting into two or more entities focused on patented and off-patent drugs to slim down its operations and maximize value to shareholders. “I think the consolidation is being driven by companies that have the cash and want to accelerate their portfolio,” he said at Thursday’s event.\nLes Funtleyder , healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management, says acquiring Allergan could be one way to ensure each division is strong enough to stand on its own before the company breaks up.\n“You want as many products as you can going through the same channel to leverage efficiencies of scale,” he says. “So the bigger you are, the easier it is to operate in various product classes and therapeutic classes.”\nAt the same time, many large companies have found that it’s often faster and cheaper to acquire a smaller company with a promising pipeline of potential drugs that are almost ready to hit the market than do the hard work of developing drugs in-house from scratch. While most pharmaceutical companies still fund robust research departments, they are increasingly looking elsewhere for products that can complement their specialties.\n“You can never have enough pipeline because products fail so often,” Funtleyder says.\nCompanies do need cash to make these purchases, and the Pfizer-Allergan deal should expand Pfizer’s financial base substantially, making it easier to be aggressive and competitive in its acquisitions. Such heft also gives the company more influence when it negotiates with governments to set drug prices outside of the U.S. or approaches suppliers with bulk orders.\n “I think everybody's trying to bulk up to have a better position to deal with the Affordable Care Act, which brought another 10 million people to the market,” Weirtheimer says. “There's profit pressure everywhere.”\nLow interest rates that barely outpace inflation have also spurred companies to be bolder in their courtship of competitors and smaller firms, as they weigh the investment potential of keeping money in a bank versus purchasing a company that can generate profits.\n“You get zero money if you put it in the bank, or you get something if you buy a company,” Funtleyder says. “Zero percent interest rates have led to misallocation of capital.”\nOf course, not every deal is a merger or acquisition. As companies strive to specialize and focus their missions, more have chosen to swap or sell off divisions that deviate from their core missions. Earlier this year, Novartis completed the trade of its vaccines division to GlaxoSmithKline in exchange for GSK’s oncology group. Companies are also entering into collaborative deals to with partners that have similar interests to cooperate in commercializing and marketing treatments in ways that neither could achieve on its own.  \n“It’s almost impossible to discover a drug and take it through clinical trials on your own – at the very least, you need to partner,” Davies says.\nPharmaceutical executives recently surveyed by Mergermarket said they expect the fury of deal-making to hold in the second half of 2015. But Wertheimer is skeptical of its long-term sustainability, and expects it to die down.\n“Merger is not very sustainable. Acquisition of another company isn’t very sustainable because you'll see a huge bolus of increase this year, and then what do you do next year?

A merger deal between Pfizer and Allergan could be the largest merger of drug \nmakers in history.	22	\N	Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have changed.\nPfizer and Allergan combine in biggest drug merger ever\nAvoiding U.S. corporate taxes\nIn one of the biggest corporate deals ever, Pfizer and Allergan announced Monday that they would combine to create the world's largest pharmaceutical giant.\nThe merger, which still needs regulatory approval, would bring blockbuster drugs like Pfizer's Lyrica, Enbrel and Viagra and Allergan's Botox and Restasis under one corporate roof.\nConsumers probably don't have to worry about big price hikes for these drugs, though.\nThere has been an intense focus on drug prices from presidential candidates after one drug company raised the price of a drug used by AIDS patients by more than 5,500%.\nBut the prices of blockbuster drugs have typically not gone up that much when two large pharmaceutical companies merge. Instead, the huge price spikes are usually by smaller companies that own drugs for rare diseases.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan merger, worth approximately $160 billion, would be the second-largest of all time, according to Dealogic, behind only the 1999 merger of two telecommunications firms.\nThe companies said they expected the deal to close by the end 2016.\nAllergan ( AGN ) , based in Dublin, is best known as the maker of Botox.\nThe combined company would top industry leaders Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Novartis ( NVS ) in terms of sales and market value.\nThe mega deal is also the latest example of the massive wave of consolidation in health care. Drug makers, insurers, hospitals and pharmacies have raced to bulk up in recent years as the business landscape has been altered by Obamacare and an aging population.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan announcement is expected to be controversial in political circles.\nThe deal would move New York-based Pfizer ( PFE ) to Ireland -- making it the latest merger that will let a U.S. company slash its federal corporate tax bill.\nPfizer has been openly critical of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Last year, when it tried unsuccessfully to acquire British drug maker AstraZeneca, Pfizer didn't hide the fact that tax savings were one of the main drivers.\nMergers like Pfizer-Allergan are known as tax inversions. In such deals, bigger American companies buy smaller foreign ones and then switch their headquarters (at least on paper) to the location of the smaller company.\nBurger King made headlines last year when it bought Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons and moved its address to Canada.\nInversions are legal but have been criticized, particularly by Democrats, as a way for companies to beat Uncle Sam.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department unveiled new rules Thursday to make it harder for companies to do inversions. But without Congressional action, the Treasury rules were not expected alone to stop a Pfizer-Allergan tie up.\n--CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.\nRelated: U.S. missing out to corporate tax havens\nCNNMoney (New York) November 23, 2015: 8:28 AM ET\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Stay up to date on:\nPharma Company News ∣ Generic Drug Companies ∣ Pharmaceutical Marketing & Sales ∣ FDA Regulations & Warnings ∣ Phase IV Clinical Trials\nClick here to see a sample.\nGSK CEO Andrew Witty\nSome analysts may be pooh-poohing a Pfizer ( $PFE ) buyout of GlaxoSmithKline ( $GSK ), but some investors are hip to the idea. As Bloomberg reports, options traders are paying record prices for bullish GSK options--and this after the British drugmaker lost $11 billion off its market cap in less than three months.\nMuch of that interest has to do with chatter about a Pfizer takeover, traders told the news service. But it's not the only factor.\nThere's also some speculation about CEO Andrew Witty , who looks vulnerable these days, what with sales of GSK's top-selling Advair sliding downhill, and follow-up respiratory meds Anoro and Breo so far failing to take up much slack.\n"A lot of this is down to rumors about a merger with Pfizer," Tavira Monaco Sam trader Kari Olsen told Bloomberg . "There is also talk that if the CEO does go, the stock can spike up some 10% on the back of people thinking that the company can then start restructuring and sell some assets."\nWitty's answer to his Advair predicament, revealed along with first-quarter earnings earlier this month, is high-volume sales of lower-priced products such as vaccines, OTC meds and consumer health staples, such as toothpaste.\nMakes sense; the company just doubled down on vaccines and the consumer business in its multibillion-dollar asset swap with Novartis ( $NVS ). But the idea wasn't popular with some investors, who see that kind of slow, steady growth as, well, too slow.\nAs Bloomberg notes, an average of 800 Glaxo options changed hands every day in May. That's 17% more than in April--more than double the usual daily amount over the past two years.\nOf course, deal talk can be just that. Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert suggested last week that GSK might be a nice solution to Pfizer's deal needs; the U.S. company may have failed to snag AstraZeneca ( $AZN ), but GSK's ability to beef up Pfizer's vaccines and consumer health operations would be worth the effort, Gilbert said in an investor note. Plus, the buy would boost Pfizer's earnings by up to 16% beginning next year.\nGilbert's suggestion touched off debate, of course, with other analysts saying a bid for GSK would be every bit as problematic as Pfizer's failed offer for AstraZeneca. Perhaps more so, even. Louis Capital Markets analyst Ben Kelly now tells Bloomberg that a Pfizer-GSK merger is unlikely for all the reasons the AZ deal didn't make.\n"Glaxo is a U.K. national champion--a bid for the company would cause a rehash of all that political and nationalistic furor," Kelly told the news service. "There would also be political pressure against a deal in the U.S. as it's very clear there would be a strong tax-inversion rationale, and we have elections coming up there next year."\n- read the Bloomberg story\n| Presented by: Veeva Systems | December 10th, 2015\nJoin us for this webinar to learn how the Veeva TMF Maturity Model for Life Sciences can help you evaluate your TMF operating model and create a strategy that propels your organization along the TMF continuum.

New Line of BLT: Bacon, Lipitor, and Tomato.\nLast night’s unexpected merger between Pfizer and McDonald’s sent shock waves through Wall Street, the Pharmaceutical industry and the heavily-processed meat community.\n“It was a no-brainer, really” remarked Pfizer CEO Ian Read. ‘These beloved brands have long enjoyed a symbiotic corporate relationship.  We finally decided that as long as McDonald’s is creating new patients for our medications – medications which keep their consumers alive and able to keep walking back to enjoy those 99-cent specials - why not work together?’\nThe top-secret negotiations, months in the making, sent stock prices soaring as McDonald’s franchises unveiled a new "McHealth Menu" that reflects the revised business model of McDonald’s/Pfizer (now listed as ‘McPfiz’ on the S&P 500).\n‘The New McBLT, featuring Bacon, Lipitor & Tomato, redefines health & commerce’ says Fred Golgoth, McDonald’s VP of  Globalization & Happy Meal Toy Development.    ‘It’s a logical progression – together we’ll give people the tasty food products they love, and, should said products threaten their health, we also provide the drugs to neutralize that threat.”\nNew meals include the  Angus Chipotle Zithromax BBQ Burger, which provides powerful antibiotics to combat fungal infection, in addition to the undetermined antibiotics injected during a cow’s short life before slaughter.       \nCustomer activity indicates strong approval for the merger amongst McDonald’s regulars.  At a franchise in Bullwhallop, Texas, hungry diner Sue Gompfolker opted for the Premium Crispy Chicken McLyrica Classic.  “I’ve got a generalized anxiety disorder, and this allows me to get the anticonvulsant I need, with the bacon I crave.”\nMs.  Gompfolker’s elderly mother,  Anna, opted for the Big N’ Tasty Celebrex  Burger with Mushrooms & Swiss.  “Why should I worry about the colon polyps when I’m also eating the cure?” she merrily chirped from her mechanized scooter.  \nUpcoming entrees include the Premium Honey Mustard Diflucan Wrap (with co-pay),  the Southern Style Grilled McDouble Viagra Wrap (Ranch),  and the all-new McZyloprimRib with Red Meat Wrap for gout sufferers.\n“It’s the circle of life” remarked McDonald’s VP Golgoth. “Pfizer had the vision to partner with the largest fast-food chain in the world.”   When reminded that Subway recently surpassed McDonald’s as the largest chain,  Golgoth replied “Yes, but we’ve still got the largest customers.”  Subway is rumored to be in talks with Merck.\nThe newly merged company has already secured preliminary approval from Health and Human Services for Medicare and Medicaid to cover the cost of McDonald's Health Menu meals. A small co-pay may be required where brand-name drugs are used, or HHS deems the health-threat of McIngredients to be abnormally high.\nFuture corporate plans include development of a nationwide Insurance Provider Network, tentatively titled ‘McHMO.’ 	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:13.125212-06
28	1	Drug Giant Pfizer To Merge With Allergan In Deal To Lower Corporate	http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/23/457081108/drug-giant-pfizer-to-merge-with-allergan-in-deal-to-lower-corporate-taxes	Nov 23, 2015 ... The U.S. drug giant Pfizer and its smaller rival Allergan have agreed to merge, \ncreating the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by sales.	28	\N	The Pfizer flag flies in front of its world headquarters in New York. Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan will merge, creating the world's biggest drug-maker by sales. Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP\nThe Pfizer flag flies in front of its world headquarters in New York. Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan will merge, creating the world's biggest drug-maker by sales. Mark Lennihan/AP\nThe U.S. drug giant Pfizer and its smaller rival Allergan have agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by sales.\nThe $160 billion deal is the largest example so far of a corporate inversion, in which a U.S. company merges with a foreign company and shifts its domicile overseas in order to lower its corporate taxes.\nBecause Allergan is based in Dublin, New York-based Pfizer can move its corporate home to Ireland, where the official tax rate is lower. But it will essentially remain the same company, with the same name, CEO and even the same stock ticker symbol.\nThe deal, which was approved unanimously by the boards of the two companies on Sunday, brings together the makers of Viagra and Botox, creating a drug industry powerhouse, The Wall Street Journal reports . The newspaper adds:\n"The merger will create a pharmaceutical behemoth, with top-selling products including Pfizer's Prevnar pneumonia vaccine and Allergan's anti-wrinkle treatment Botox and industry-topping R&D budget. The company's drugs and vaccines would cover a range of diseases, from Alzheimer's to cancer, eye health to rheumatoid arthritis."\nIn a statement , Pfizer CEO Ian Read said the deal "will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world":\n"Allergan's businesses align with and enhance Pfizer's businesses, creating best-in-class, sustainable, innovative and established businesses that are poised for growth.\n"Through this combination, Pfizer will have greater financial flexibility that will facilitate our continued discovery and development of new innovative medicines for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continued investment in the United States, while also enabling our pursuit of business development opportunities on a more competitive footing within our industry."\nThe merger is likely to be controversial and increase pressure on Congress to take on the inversion trend.\nThe Treasury Department proposed new rules to make inversions somewhat tougher to pull off several days ago, but the Obama administration says congressional action is needed to really address the issue.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:13.137502-06
19	1	Is This The Biggest Roadblock to a Pfizer-Allergan Merger? -- The ...	http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/17/the-biggest-roadblock-to-a-pfizer-allergan-deal-ma.aspx	Nov 17, 2015 ... Pfizer's legacy products may get left out in the cold if the drugmaker goes through \nwith a proposed merger with Botox-maker Allergan.	19	\N	Is This The Biggest Roadblock to a Pfizer-Allergan Merger?\nPfizer's legacy products may get left out in the cold if the drugmaker goes through with a proposed merger with Botox-maker Allergan.\nNov 17, 2015 at 8:29AM\nPfizer ( NYSE:PFE ) and Allergan ( NYSE:AGN ) are reportedly discussing the possibility of a friendly merger between the two pharma giants that could take place before year's end. This proposed deal has drawn broad interest in the media because of the so-called 'tax inversion' component, whereby Pfizer would lower its 26% effective tax rate by relocating to Ireland, after buying the Botox-maker. \nSource: Flickr via user Oceanview Med Spa\nHowever, I think the media has missed the real story, and perhaps the biggest roadblock to a merger, by blowing the tax inversion angle out of proportion. Here's why. \nThese merger talks were not spurred by Pfizer's tax problem The impetus behind a Pfizer-Allergan merger would, point blank, be growth -- not taxes. Because of the loss of exclusivity for several former blockbuster drugs, Pfizer's top-line has been stagnating for several quarters now, despite the launch of multiple new growth products (more on this later).\nAt last count, Pfizer's total revenues through the first nine months of 2015, for example, declined by 5% compared to the same period a year ago. A quick look under the hood, however, reveals that the main problem is Pfizer's Global Established Pharmaceuticals (GEP) segment, which saw its sales slip by 13%, on an operational basis, in the third quarter, relative to a year ago. By contrast, Pfizer's Innovative Products business saw its sales gap up by 21%, on an operational basis, in the same period. \nSource: Pfizer\nTo solve this problem, Pfizer could chose to pair its Innovative Products with Allergan's branded pharma business (following the latter's divestiture of its generic segment) to form a streamlined, ultra-high growth company that would sport a four-headed monster consisting of Botox, Prevnar 13, Ibrance, and Eliquis. This new company, in theory, should be able to generate 20% plus growth on its top and bottom-lines for several years running. In short, this proposed merger makes sense from a growth perspective and any tax benefits would simply be icing on the cake. \nBut here's the problem... It's no secret that Pfizer wants to split its Established Products and Innovative Products segments into two separate entities, and it only makes sense to pair the Innovative segment with Allergan for the reasons outlined above.\nBy carving out the Innovative Products business via a merger with Allergan, though, Pfizer's Established Products business would be left in no man's land. As I mentioned previously, this particular segment is experiencing double-digit sales declines because of falling sales for drugs like Celebrex and Zyvox. And even the recent acquisition of Hospira isn't enough to reverse this trend. With over $18 billion in sales in the last nine months, the sheer size of this business also implies that it can't be easily repackaged and sold off to a company specializing in generics.\nWhile this unit is still throwing off tons of positive free cash, Allergan's management probably doesn't want to take on this problem. After all, it would turn a large company with a rapidly growing top-line into an absolutely bloated megagiant with a market cap of over $300 billion and a flat top-line. That's not a smart business move, especially after the company struck a deal not long ago to jettison its own generic business in order to focus on branded products. In other words, this merger may ultimately hinge on what Pfizer's management decides to do with its legacy products.  \nWhat's next? Although the media has honed in on the tax inversion issue, I don't think it will play much of a role if a deal ultimately goes through. The bigger problem is the fate of Pfizer's Established Products business that's literally sinking under an avalanche of patent problems. Not many investors are going to line up to buy into a company with a plunging top and bottom-line after all.\nPfizer's management therefore has to make an extremely tough call on a business that is still generating boatloads of free cash, but no revenue growth to speak of. And that's a much more pressing issue, at least in my mind, than shaving a few points off of Pfizer's effective tax rate.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The merged company is expected to have an adjusted effective tax rate of 17 to 18 percent in the first full year after the transaction is closed, compared with Pfizer’s expected 25 percent effective tax rate for 2015, according to a Pfizer spokesman.\nClinton called upon regulators to see if they can take stronger actions to prevent corporations from moving earnings overseas, and she urged Congress to “act immediately to make sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share."\n“Republicans should stop trying to tilt the tax code even further in favor of the super wealthy and the largest corporations and join us in supporting these necessary reforms on behalf of U.S. taxpayers,” the former Secretary of State said.\nSanders criticized the merger not just because it would allow Pfizer to “hide its profits overseas” but also because it would hurt those who need prescription medications.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” the Vermont Senator said.\nSanders added that the Obama administration should exercise its authority to halt the merger and that “Congress also must pass real tax reform that demands that profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley called the merger "fundamentally unfair."\n \n“Recent mergers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries will reduce competition, reduce choice, and raise prices for American consumers," O'Malley said. "As President, I will aggressively enforce our antitrust laws to counter dramatic price increases in healthcare, while fighting to close corporate tax loopholes that allow giant companies to dodge taxes and offshore their profits."\n \nAnchor_menu Home Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Contact Advertise Subscriptions\nThe Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax\nThe contents of this site are ©2015 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:13.143492-06

Read previously tried to move Pfizer's corporate headquarters offshore by buying Britain’s AstraZeneca in a controversial $119 billion takeover bid. That bid failed, in part, because of objections by U.S. and U.K. lawmakers.\nPresident Obama has repeatedly called such overseas mergers and tax-evasion tactics “unpatriotic.” The Treasury Department just passed new rules intended to stop U.S. corporations from buying foreign firms as a way to evade taxes. In this deal, however, Ireland-based Allergan is buying Pfizer, even though Pfizer is the larger company. That gambit allows it to evade the new Treasury rules.\nThe New York Times reported that Pfizer “kept $74 billion in earnings offshore last year to avoid” paying U.S. corporate taxes.\nSanders has repeatedly criticized the greed-driven approach exemplified by the Pfizer merger, most recently at last week’s Georgetown University speech where he described what democratic socialism meant to him and would mean for the nation if he were elected president.\nSanders singled out the U.S. drug industry for price-gouging consumers, describing its notorious lobbying achievement of getting legislation passed barring federal officials who run Medicare, the government health program for seniors, from negotiating for lower prices.\nSteven Rosenfeld covers national political issues for AlterNet, including America's retirement crisis, democracy and voting rights, and campaigns and elections.

Pharma giant Pfizer is to combine with Allergan in a $160 billion (£106 billion) \nmega-merger. The deal is being positioned as Irish-based ...	27	\N	27 November 2015 Anthony King\nPharma giant Pfizer is to combine with Allergan in a $160 billion (£106 billion) mega-merger. The deal is being positioned as Irish-based Allergan taking over Pfizer, with the merged entity resident in Ireland for tax purposes. This will save billions of dollars in future tax bills, but do little for new drug discovery.\nPfizer boss Ian Read claims the deal is motivated by more than just tax, but analysts and politicians are unconvinced © Matt Dunham/AP/Press Association Images\nPfizer, which will retain its operational headquarters in the US, flagged expected savings of $2 billion from operating expenses, with a third coming from R&D. Pfizer today invests $7 billion in R&D, the vast majority of which is in the US.\n‘Pfizer said last quarter that it was going to reduce all costs. One of the easiest to reduce is the tax liability. That is what it has done,’ says Steve Brozak , president of WBB Securities in San Diego, US. The move will bulk up revenue and cut expenses but will do nothing to add to the drug pipeline. The deal sidesteps the US treasury’s tightened rules designed to deter companies from pursuing ‘inversion’ deals to move their bases abroad and reduce their tax rates. It is not technically an inversion, since Allergan is nominally doing the buying, but will massively cut Pfizer’s US tax bill – from 25% to 17% by some estimates.\nThere are other benefits to the deal, according to industry observers. Analyst Alastair McCaig at IG in London, UK, says the $6–8 billion of tax savings is not to be sniffed at, but points to other drivers. ‘There is a good fit between the businesses,’ he says.\nThere is not a lot of overlap between the two companies’ drug portfolios, which makes them complementary. Allergan is strong in aesthetics – centred around Botox (onabotulinum toxin A); eye care; anti-infectives; gastrointestinal and neurology – areas Pfizer exited or de-prioritised some years ago.  \nUpsides, but not new drugs\nMerger and acquisition activity by Pfizer was not unexpected. ‘Pfizer needed to replenish its basket of approved drugs. It needed to buy products that were already available on the market, specifically in the US, where the profit premiums are so much greater,’ says McCaig. ‘Part of the reason is that in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies effectively battened down the hatches and cut costs. They were reluctant to spend money, reduced head count and cut back on R&D. And now they find themselves with this shortfall or inability to produce new drugs.’\n‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens’ While Pfizer invests in significant in-house R&D, Allergan has tended to buy potential targets in the drug discovery phase. ‘Unlike the AstraZeneca case, this probably won’t have a significant impact on R&D operations,’ says Aris Angelis from the London School of Economics, UK. ‘There might be some reasonable workforce optimisation, but there is not much therapeutic area complementarity between the two companies and Allergan’s R&D should not suffer much.’\nThat said, mergers are not known for driving new drug discovery. ‘I would not expect a significant increase in innovative output from the combined new company,’ adds Angelis, who criticised  last year’s proposed AstraZeneca–Pfizer deal , and recently  blogged  about the proposed Allergan–Pfizer embrace. \nHe is not alone in his pessimism. ‘The question now is: what will Pfizer–Allergan buy next. Or it could start spinning things off, but where is it going to get new drugs from?’ asks Brozak. ‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens that are basically driving these entities,’ he says. ‘What I care about is the value of the shares tomorrow, and that isn’t driven by tax codes. It is driven by discovery of new healthcare products and technologies.’\nThe hurdles ahead\nThe new company will have better access to cash to invest in R&D and manufacturing, according to Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive . ‘I want to stress that we are not doing this transaction simply as a tax transaction. We are doing this because of the strategic importance of the franchises, the revenue growth we believe we can get within the US and internationally, and the importance to combine the research approaches,’ Read said on Monday in a call with analysts.\nThe move also gives Allergan access to 70 markets it does not operate in today. Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said during the call with analysts that the company has almost zero presence in some of the biggest markets, such as Japan, the second biggest pharmaceutical market in the world. ‘You have a multi-billion dollar business in Pfizer that already exists there. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our product flow into Japan in an efficient way. [That] issue is solved through this transaction,’ he said.\nThe new entity will continue to be called Pfizer, with Pfizer stockholders owning around 56% and Allergan shareholders 44%. The deal must be approved by both sets of shareholders, as well as regulators in the US and the EU.\nThere is concern among investors that the deal could be stymied by the US government. Some analysts say Allergan and Pfizer are understating potential tax and other savings in the face of US political opposition to tax inversions.\nThe union will require 9 months gestation, and analysts say this gives time for the US government to undercut it. Already, the leading US presidential candidates have criticised Pfizer’s actions. But Pfizer has learned from the experience of trying to merge with AstraZeneca last year and has tried to cover all its bases. It neatly sidestepped new rules to impede tax inversions from the US Treasury, which has admitted it can do little more to prevent the deals without legislation from Congress. 	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:13.131689-06

Now, the Allergan name is being retired as part of a $160-billion merger with rival \nPfizer Inc. that would create the world's largest drugmaker.	14	\N	Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images\nPfizer and Allergan will combine under Allergan Plc, which will be renamed Pfizer Plc.\nPfizer and Allergan will combine under Allergan Plc, which will be renamed Pfizer Plc. (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images)\nJim Puzzanghera and Samantha Masunaga Contact Reporters\nMore than 65 years ago, a Los Angeles drugstore owner installed a laboratory above one of his shops to make a product that would discourage children from sucking their thumbs.\nThe operation quickly changed focus to an antihistamine eye drop called Allergan. Renamed after that drug, the firm moved to Irvine and grew into a global pharmaceutical giant.\nNow, the Allergan name is being retired as part of a $160-billion merger with rival Pfizer Inc. that would create the world's largest drugmaker.\nThe long-expected stock-and-debt deal — the second-biggest ever — already is drawing fire for being the most creative attempt yet at avoiding U.S. corporate taxes. It also is raising fears of higher drug prices for consumers.\nAlthough Pfizer is the larger company, the deal unveiled Monday is structured so that Allergan, now an Irish company, is technically the buyer.\nThe move is a twist on a controversial tactic known as inversion, in which a U.S. firm buys a smaller foreign competitor in a lower-tax nation and shifts the merged company's headquarters there to reduce taxes.\nThe White House and the two leading Democratic presidential candidates quickly blasted the Pfizer-Allergan tie-up as a corporate tax dodge.\n“This proposed merger, and so-called inversions by other companies, will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag,” said Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nThe new firm would be called Pfizer and would be led by its current chief executive, Ian Read. Although its global operational headquarters would be in New York, the merged company's principal executive offices would be in Dublin to take advantage of Ireland's low corporate tax rate.\nPfizer and Allergan said the effective tax rate of the new company would be 17% to 18%, well below Pfizer's effective tax rate last year of 25.5%.\nU.S. companies have stepped up their use of inversions in recent years as foreign countries have been lowering their tax rates to lure corporate headquarters.\nNew Treasury Department regulations, including ones issued just last week, have made the tactic somewhat more difficult. But the Pfizer-Allergan deal is structured as a foreign acquisition to avoid those rules, said Larry Harding, vice chairman of Radius, a firm that helps U.S. companies operate overseas.\n“It's definitely an interesting inflection point and has ratcheted up the issue,” Harding said.\nLowering Pfizer's taxes wasn't the only motivation in the merger, which Read said would give the company more “financial flexibility” to invest in research, development and manufacturing.\n“I want to stress that we're not doing this transaction simply as a tax transaction,” he told investors on a conference call.\nLater, on CNBC-TV, Read called the merger “a great deal for America,” where the new firm would have 40,000 employees.\nAllergan has about 2,100 employees in Irvine and 300 in Corona out of a worldwide workforce of 30,000.\n“We will continue to pump in $9 billion globally into research, mostly in the United States,” Read said. “These sort of resources are being brought together to cure major illnesses for humanity.”\nPfizer is known for the cholesterol-lowering medication Lipitor and the male erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.\nAllergan was acquired in March by the Irish drugmaker Actavis in a $66-billion deal that thwarted a takeover attempt by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. The new company kept the Allergan name.\nThe Pfizer deal values Allergan at $363.63 a share, about 30% more than its price when reports of a deal first surfaced last month.\nAllergan shareholders would get 11.3 shares of the new company for each of their shares. Pfizer shareholders would get one share of the new company's stock for each of their shares, but have the option of receiving cash, up to a total of $12 billion, for some or all of their shares.\nAfter the deal closes, Pfizer shareholders would own 56% of the combined company. U.S. and European regulators must approve the transaction.\nThe stock of both companies dropped Monday. Allergan fell $10.76, or 3.4%, to $301.70. Pfizer shares dropped 86 cents, or 2.7%, to $31.32.\nJamie Court, president of advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, worried that the consolidation of two pharmaceutical giants would lead to higher drug prices because of decreased competition.\n“Certain patients are going to not only see elevated prices, but potentially a loss of choice,” he said.\nOn the campaign trail, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, called on the Obama administration to block the deal.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said. “It also would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas.”\nBut industry analyst Richard Purkiss, managing director at investment banker Piper Jaffray, said he thought the merger would have little effect on consumers.\n“Pricing is mainly a function of what competition there is, and this doesn't give the company any greater power in most of its categories because they're not particularly overlapping businesses,” he said.\nPurkiss didn't think there were many barriers to the deal's completion. But as the largest inversion-type merger so far, Pfizer and Allergan could face regulatory hurdles in Washington, said Maxim Jacobs, an analyst at Edison Investment Research.\nRep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said inversions have cost the U.S. government tens of billions of dollars in tax revenue and that the Pfizer-Allergan deal should spur lawmakers to take action.\nPresident Obama believes “it is not fair for companies to essentially renounce their citizenship [and] seek to, at least on paper, relocate themselves somewhere else so they can pay a lower tax rate,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.\nObama and Democrats have sought to change the tax law to prohibit inversion-type deals, but bills proposed in the House and the Senate last year still have not gone to hearings in the Republican-controlled Congress.\nMeantime, the administration has tried to make inversions more difficult. Last week, the Treasury Department added to prior restrictions by issuing technical rules that would limit the ability of U.S. companies to merge with foreign firms to avoid corporate taxes.\nClinton said she would propose specific steps in the coming weeks to stop inversions.\nSome Republicans also have criticized inversions but said the solution is to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate significantly to reduce the incentive to reincorporate overseas. Ireland has a 12.5% corporate tax rate. The U.S. rate is 35%, the highest of any developed economy.\nRep. Charles Boustany (R-La.) called the latest deal “a sad reflection of our broken tax code, which is driving businesses away from the United States instead of encouraging them to grow here at home.”\nThe Business Roundtable, a trade association of chief executives at major corporations, said inversions were “a self-help solution to compete in the global marketplace” and predicted they would continue until the corporate tax code is overhauled.\nBut with bipartisan attempts at tax reform efforts stalling, legislation is unlikely until after next year's presidential election.\nBesides the tax benefits, the companies expect to save $2 billion in the combination. Pfizer executives had talked about splitting their company in two soon, one focused on developing new products and the other focused on established drugs. But they said Monday that they won't be in a position to consider that option until the end of 2018.\nThe deal has a breakup fee of as much as $3.5 billion, which either company has the right to exercise.\njim.puzzanghera@latimes.com\n9:41 p.m.: Updates with additional details and background\n9:30 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional comments and reaction.\n5:43 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional details.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.920043-06

Small Dublin-based Allergan will buy Pfizer to form world's largest drug maker.	25	\N	With $160 billion merger, Pfizer moves to Ireland and dodges taxes\nSmall Dublin-based Allergan will buy Pfizer to form world’s largest drug maker.\nby Beth Mole - Nov 23, 2015 5:59 pm UTC\nIn what’s called a “reverse-inversion,” Allergan, a small Dublin-based drug company that makes products such as Botox, will technically buy the US-based pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer, which makes products such as Viagra and Lipitor.\nThe $160 billion merger, officially announced Monday , will allow Pfizer to move its executive offices to Ireland, thus lowering its tax rate, while also morphing into the world’s largest drug maker.\nSuch inversions, which are said to cost the American government billions in lost tax revenue, have drawn scorn from the Obama Administration and the Treasury Department. Last year, President Obama referred to the deals as “ unpatriotic” loopholes and proposed to close them. And last week, the Treasury announced new rules to make such deals more difficult.\nBut Pfizer’s reverse-inversion skirts the rules, in part by keeping ownership split somewhat evenly between the two companies. After the deal is complete, current shareholders of Allergan, which has the majority of its operations in the US, will own 44 percent of the mega company. The remaining 56 percent will be owned by current Pfizer shareholders.\nIn Monday’s announcement, Pfizer said that the deal will deliver $2 billion in cost savings per year for the first three years. By 2018, the combined company, which will also be called Pfizer, will have an operating cash flow of $25 billion.\nThe merged company will also enjoy a 17 to 18 percent tax rate, Pfizer said. That’s down from Pfizer’s current US tax rate of about 25 percent .\nChairman and CEO of Pfizer Ian Read was quoted in the announcement as saying, “The proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover, and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”\nThe company said it expects that the deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, will be done by the second half of 2016. Lawmakers and healthcare professionals are currently monitoring and investigating  such large mergers between pharmaceutical companies and their impacts on healthcare costs.\nLatest Feature Story Feature Story (2 pages) Pixel C review—New hardware ignores an Android tablet’s core problem: software	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:13.118039-06
32	2	Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S. | Reuters	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-m-a-pfizer-idUSKCN0SN01P20151030	Oct 30, 2015 ... Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no ... had not seen \ndetails of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion ...	2	\N	By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson\nPfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.\nBoth New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.\nAllergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.\nPfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\nA spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n"Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas," Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: "The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them."\nFrom the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.\nSMOOTHER PATH\n"These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore," he said in a statement. "We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."\nBillionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.\nAnalysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.\nCredit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.\nEarlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.\n"Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses," Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. "I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back."\nPfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.\nGiven that both sides characterized the talks as "friendly," Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.\n"It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca," said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. "The hurdle will really be the price."\nMoody's Investor Service said the deal would have "credit positive implications for both companies."\nA tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.\nRead said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.\nPfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.\nAllergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.\nCASH FROM BOTOX\nA purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.\nIt would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.\nAllergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.\nPfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.\nSince the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.\nThe deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.\nApart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.\nBy Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOther large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.\n(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb )\nTraders gather at the post that trades Allergan stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange October 29, 2015.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.278066-06

35	2	The Pfizer–Allergan Merger Is a Disgrace - The New Yorker	http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace	Nov 23, 2015 ... John Cassidy writes about the proposed merger between pharmaceutical giant \nPfizer and an Ireland-based competitor, Allergan.	5	\N	Ian Read, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, says merging with Allergan would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.” Credit Photograph by Ben Cawthra / Rex Features via AP\nIn an announcement on Monday morning,  Pfizer , the big drug company, whose headquarters are on East 42nd Street, in Manhattan, said that it is merging with one of its competitors, Allergan PLC. Ian Read, a Scottish-born accountant who is Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said that the proposed deal, which is valued at a hundred and sixty billion dollars, would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”\nOn Wall Street and in the world of big pharma, that statement will raise chuckles. It is widely acknowledged that the primary impetus for the deal is a financial one. In merging with Allergan , which is based in Dublin, Pfizer intends to move its corporate residency to Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 per cent, compared to thirty-five per cent for a company of its size in the United States. Over the next few years, the merger could save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes and deprive the U.S. Treasury of the same amount.\nTax-driven deals of this nature are known as “ inversions ,” and they are becoming increasingly common. Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad. Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  said that inversions were “wrong,”  and that he would try and restrict them. Only last week, the Treasury Department  issued some new administrative guidelines in this area. Without actual legislation, though, there isn’t very much the Obama Administration can do to prevent these exercises in corporate tax-dodging, and Republicans on Capitol Hill have displayed little eagerness to coöperate in a crackdown.\nThe Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace. Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Now, Pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, particularly profits generated by its overseas subsidiaries. Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.\nFounded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals. Its first commercial product was an anti-parasitic pill designed to fight intestinal worms, which were a common affliction at the time. In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills. During the Second World War, it developed a new way of making penicillin, which was then seen as a miracle drug. After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine. During the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it invested heavily in R. & D., boosting its research budget to about twenty per cent of its sales. These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction). In 1999, when Pfizer celebrated its hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it was widely seen as the leading drug company in the world.\nPfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research. Since 2010, though, when Read took over as chief executive, it has cut its R. & D. budget significantly and raised its spending on stock buybacks. Under Read’s leadership,  cost-cutting  and financial engineering have sometimes seemed to be driving the company’s strategy. To some extent, these kinds of changes were unavoidable. As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.\nSo, like many other big American corporations, Pfizer is facing challenges adapting to a changed world. But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails. A venerable member of the Fortune 500 now looks for all the world like a greedy tax exile, skipping off to a dodgy foreign locale. (Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is  distinctly dodgy .)\nRead, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergan, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States. However, there is scant evidence that being based in the United States has handicapped Pfizer or made it more difficult for the company to raise capital.\nTo the contrary, being based in the United States enables Pfizer to exploit the vast reservoirs of technical expertise that reside here, and to access federal support for scientific research. For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health. And being headquartered in the United States certainly hasn’t prevented Pfizer from making a lot of money. Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.\nAll things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity. If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through. Its lead independent director is Dennis Ausiello, an eminent physician who, for many years, was chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other non-executives  on the Pfizer board  include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital. These directors are all experienced, worldly individuals. Last year, according to Pfizer’s 2015 proxy statement , they were each paid more than three hundred thousand dollars to carry out their duties, which include overseeing the company’s full-time management and protecting the long-term interests of all of its stakeholders: employees, shareholders, and customers.\nOne of those key interests, surely, is safeguarding Pfizer’s reputation, which has already suffered in recent years, following a big  marketing scandal  over the since-discontinued painkiller Bextra and other missteps. Read has for years been telling shareholders in his annual letter to them that “earning greater respect from society” is one of Pfizer’s strategic imperatives. One of the ways the company could do this, he said, was through “acting as a respectable corporate citizen.” So here is a question for the independent directors: Do you really think that traducing Pfizer’s proud history by moving to Dublin and shafting American taxpayers would be the act of a “respectable corporate citizen”?\nSign up for the daily newsletter.

36	2	Pfizer-Allergan Merger Won't Lead to New, Innovative Drugs - US ...	http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/11/24/pfizer-allergan-merger-wont-lead-to-new-innovative-drugs	Nov 24, 2015 ... Instead, the creation of the world's largest drug company will likely inspire more \nmergers and acquisitions.	6	\N	Pfizer-Allergan Merger Won't Lead to New, Innovative Drugs\nInstead, the creation of the world's largest drug company will likely inspire more mergers and acquisitions.\nThe $160 billion merger between Pfizer and Allergan has created the world's largest drug company. \nBy Steve Sternberg Nov. 24, 2015 | 5:41 p.m. EST + More\nIf romance writers covered the drug industry, they might say Pfizer married Ireland-based Allergan on the rebound.\nThe union of Pfizer and Allergan comes a year and a half after Pfizer was jilted by London-based drug-maker AstraZenica, maker of the blockbuster heart drug Crestor, following a whirlwind, seven-month courtship and an offer totaling approximately $104 billion. What made both companies especially appealing are their offshore addresses, which would allow Pfizer to benefit from lower corporate tax rates, potentially saving millions in U.S. taxes.\nThe $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan deal instantly turned the combined company, Pfizer Plc, into the world's largest drug maker. The windfall tax savings will likely give the new Pfizer a big competitive advantage against major U.S.-based drug firms with thousands of employees, such as Merck & Co., Eli Lilly and Company and Johnson & Johnson. What it will not do, experts say, is ramp up the development of innovative new drugs for consumers.\nThat's because the companies' research portfolios are so different. "The fields in which they're operating don't overlap much," says David Collis, of Harvard Business School. "Will putting these two companies together produce a better company than can deliver more and better drugs to more people? That's hard to see."\nIt will likely spur other mergers and acquisitions—possibly making AstraZenica an even more alluring target. Companies that once focused on developing drugs in-house will adopt Pfizer's model of finding attractive companies with promising drugs and buying them up. "I think it will increase the cost of health care," says Dr. Donald Conway, of the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College.\nDespite Pfizer's $7 billion to $8 billion investment in innovative drug research, Conway says, the company's drug development pipeline has been relatively weak. Viagra, the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug, emerged by chance, after subjects who took the drug as part of a failed pulmonary hypertension trial asked if they could continue to get it, he says.\n"They have not come up with great products," Conway says. "Viagra was serendipity. They stumbled into a market that didn't exist before they got there."\nFor much of its recent history, Pfizer's monumental success stems from astute mergers and acquisitions, including Warner-Lambert; Pharmacia, along with its blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex; Wyeth; and now Allergan, the maker of Botox, with a promising research and development pipeline, focusing mainly on eye-care, neuroscience, dermatology and gastrointestinal illnesses.\n"Pfizer is expert at first partnering with someone and then having a good, solid team of business analysts estimate what the asset is really worth. Then they buy the company. That's what happened with Celebrex ," Conway says. "G.D. Searle held the intellectual property. Searle merged with Pharmacia and Pfizer bought Pharmacia."\nIn an early-morning call with investors Monday, officers of the two drug-makers portrayed their deal as a boon for health care. Pfizer trumpeted Allergan's strength in drug classes Pfizer had "exited" due to weak returns. The new Pfizer inherits Allergan's pipeline of more than 70 experimental drugs, which includes a new line of biosimilars--essentially me-too versions of existing biotech drugs, says Mahud Hassan, director of the pharmaceutical management program at Rutgers University.\nThese drugs take advantage of existing biotech markets, Hassan says, though their profit margin is significantly smaller than standard generic drugs, which don't require biotechnology to produce.\nFor its part, Allergan cited quick access to Pfizer's global markets. And both firms are likely to benefit from operating synergies that will allow both to cut costs and likely trim back their workforces.\nThe tax savings give Pfizer a big competitive edge, because they free up cash to do other deals, such as buying small but innovative biotech or pharma companies.\nPfizer officials said that the relocated firm would have an effective tax rate of 18 percent in the first year after the deal closes, far less than the 25 percent rate the Pfizer now pays. The lower tax rates would free up billions of dollars trapped overseas giving Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," CEO Ian Read told participants on the call.\nPfizer will make the most of that money, Conway says. "Pfizer's analysts are expert at assessing an asset before they jump. They do a lot of jumping. They do it intelligently. And now they have a tax advantage to acquire smaller companies because they're competing at a more favorable tax rate."	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.302845-06

New Line of BLT: Bacon, Lipitor, and Tomato.\nLast night’s unexpected merger between Pfizer and McDonald’s sent shock waves through Wall Street, the Pharmaceutical industry and the heavily-processed meat community.\n“It was a no-brainer, really” remarked Pfizer CEO Ian Read. ‘These beloved brands have long enjoyed a symbiotic corporate relationship.  We finally decided that as long as McDonald’s is creating new patients for our medications – medications which keep their consumers alive and able to keep walking back to enjoy those 99-cent specials - why not work together?’\nThe top-secret negotiations, months in the making, sent stock prices soaring as McDonald’s franchises unveiled a new "McHealth Menu" that reflects the revised business model of McDonald’s/Pfizer (now listed as ‘McPfiz’ on the S&P 500).\n‘The New McBLT, featuring Bacon, Lipitor & Tomato, redefines health & commerce’ says Fred Golgoth, McDonald’s VP of  Globalization & Happy Meal Toy Development.    ‘It’s a logical progression – together we’ll give people the tasty food products they love, and, should said products threaten their health, we also provide the drugs to neutralize that threat.”\nNew meals include the  Angus Chipotle Zithromax BBQ Burger, which provides powerful antibiotics to combat fungal infection, in addition to the undetermined antibiotics injected during a cow’s short life before slaughter.       \nCustomer activity indicates strong approval for the merger amongst McDonald’s regulars.  At a franchise in Bullwhallop, Texas, hungry diner Sue Gompfolker opted for the Premium Crispy Chicken McLyrica Classic.  “I’ve got a generalized anxiety disorder, and this allows me to get the anticonvulsant I need, with the bacon I crave.”\nMs.  Gompfolker’s elderly mother,  Anna, opted for the Big N’ Tasty Celebrex  Burger with Mushrooms & Swiss.  “Why should I worry about the colon polyps when I’m also eating the cure?” she merrily chirped from her mechanized scooter.  \nUpcoming entrees include the Premium Honey Mustard Diflucan Wrap (with co-pay),  the Southern Style Grilled McDouble Viagra Wrap (Ranch),  and the all-new McZyloprimRib with Red Meat Wrap for gout sufferers.\n“It’s the circle of life” remarked McDonald’s VP Golgoth. “Pfizer had the vision to partner with the largest fast-food chain in the world.”   When reminded that Subway recently surpassed McDonald’s as the largest chain,  Golgoth replied “Yes, but we’ve still got the largest customers.”  Subway is rumored to be in talks with Merck.\nThe newly merged company has already secured preliminary approval from Health and Human Services for Medicare and Medicaid to cover the cost of McDonald's Health Menu meals. A small co-pay may be required where brand-name drugs are used, or HHS deems the health-threat of McIngredients to be abnormally high.\nFuture corporate plans include development of a nationwide Insurance Provider Network, tentatively titled ‘McHMO.’ 	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.291873-06
39	2	Pfizer and Allergan Reach $150 Billion Merger Deal - The New York ...	http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/business/dealbook/pfizer-and-allergan-reach-150-billion-merger-deal.html	Nov 22, 2015 ... Pfizer has clinched a blockbuster merger with a fellow drug maker, one worth \nmore than $150 billion, that can best be described in superlatives.	9	\N	Pfizer's corporate headquarters in New York City. Credit Andrew Kelly/Reuters\nPfizer has clinched a blockbuster merger with a fellow drug maker, one worth more than $150 billion, that can best be described in superlatives.\nWhen it is announced — most likely on Monday, people briefed on the matter said — the deal to buy Allergan, the maker of Botox , would be one of the biggest ever takeovers in the health care industry. And it would be the largest acquisition yet in a banner year for mergers.\nPerhaps most important, it would be the biggest transaction aimed at helping an American company shed its United States corporate citizenship in an effort to lower its tax bill, in this case by billions of dollars. And it could become a flash point as the presidential race heats up.\nA deal would come as the Obama administration is trying to crack down on these kinds of deals, known on Wall Street and in Washington as corporate inversions. Last week, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced new rules meant to further clamp down on the benefits of such mergers. The government has already lost billions of dollars in corporate tax revenue from inversions, particularly over the last couple of years.\nNew rules introduced earlier this year deterred some companies determined to pursue inversions, including AbbVie, a drug maker that called off its planned $54 billion takeover of an Irish counterpart, Shire. Still, Treasury officials said as recently as last week that only Congress can halt inversions.\nPfizer and Allergan are taking steps to sidestep the current rules altogether. Though Pfizer is significantly bigger, with a market value of $199 billion to Allergan’s $123 billion, it is Allergan that would technically be the buyer, according to the people briefed on the matter.\nBecause Allergan already has its headquarters in Dublin — even though the bulk of its operations are based in Parsippany, N.J. — the planned transaction could avoid the Treasury rules, which apply to American companies that buy foreign companies.\nBut in most respects, Pfizer would lead the combined company, which would surpass Johnson & Johnson as the biggest drug maker by revenue, with more than $60 billion in sales. Its product portfolio would run from Viagra , Celebrex and pneumonia drugs to Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm. Analysts do not expect the merger to have much effect on the prices of the companies’ drugs.\nPfizer’s chief executive, Ian Read, would hold on to that role at the combined company, these people said. His counterpart at Allergan, Brent Saunders, is expected to take a top deputy role and a board seat.\nThe boards of both Pfizer and Allergan voted on Sunday to approve the transaction, one of the people briefed on the matter said. News of the votes was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\nRepresentatives for Pfizer, Allergan and the Treasury Department declined to comment.\nAdopting Allergan’s home base of Ireland would yield significant savings for Pfizer, one of the oldest drug makers in the United States. Its history runs from producing painkillers during the Civil War to penicillin in World War II . Pfizer’s tax rate last year was roughly 26.5 percent and is expected to be about 25 percent this year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIts prospective merger partner, by contrast, reported a tax rate of just 4.8 percent for 2014, though its rate this year is about 15 percent.\nPresident Obama last year declared that such moves were “unpatriotic.” But Mr. Read has long argued that an inversion is an important step in keeping the company competitive with foreign rivals based in lower-tax countries. Under the current rules, Pfizer must pay American corporate taxes on the billions of dollars in earnings from international operations if it ever tries to bring the money back to the United States. (The company kept $74 billion in earnings offshore last year to avoid that bill.)\nHe had already tried once to shift Pfizer’s home abroad, pursuing a $119 billion takeover bid for AstraZeneca of Britain . That campaign faltered amid fervent opposition from AstraZeneca and raised the hackles of lawmakers in the United States and Britain.\nBut Mr. Read, an accountant by training, has pressed ahead with his dream of a corporate inversion. Otherwise, he told The Wall Street Journal last month, Pfizer is fighting “with one hand tied behind our back.”\nIt was unclear whether the Obama administration would announce additional rules that would stymie the merger. Continue reading the main story\nRecord Year of Deal-Making\nGiant impending deals announced this year include:\nUnder the terms of the proposed deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 Pfizer shares for each of their holdings, the people briefed on the matter said. That is worth about $363.63 a share, or 16 percent higher than Allergan’s closing price on Friday.\nThe transaction would also include a cash component, though one of the people described it as less than 10 percent of the deal’s overall value.\nPfizer shareholders would still own the majority of the combined business.\nAt more than $150 billion, the takeover would be the biggest in what has been a stellar year for deal-making, one that has astonished even veteran Wall Street financiers. Some $4 trillion in transactions had been announced as of Nov. 19, and this year is on pace to shatter the previous record of roughly $4.3 trillion set in 2007.\nAlready, giant deals announced this year include the impending $104 billion union of the beer giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller; the proposed sale of Time Warner Cable to Charter Communications for $55 billion ; and the pending sale of the data storage provider EMC to Dell for more than $60 billion .\nCorporate chieftains have turned to mergers at a rapid clip over the last three years, hoping to spur growth in their own businesses that they have been hard-pressed to attain on their own.\nPfizer itself has undertaken a number of huge takeovers, including its $68 billion takeover of Wyeth nearly seven years ago. This year, it bought Hospira, a manufacturer of generic treatments , for about $17 billion.\nAnd Allergan itself is the product of numerous mergers, including those of Forest Laboratories and Watson Pharmaceuticals . Its Irish headquarters is the product of a $5 billion merger of two predecessor companies , Actavis and Warner Chilcott.\nYet in some ways, a takeover of Allergan may eventually be followed by Pfizer splitting itself up — another trend that has taken hold on Wall Street in recent years. The bigger drug maker has weighed whether to split into two companies: one dedicated to higher-growth, brand name treatments and one focused on slower-growing mature drugs that face pressure from generic counterparts.\nMr. Saunders of Allergan would be in line to take over one of those companies if Pfizer ultimately chose to break up, the people briefed on the matter said.\nA version of this article appears in print on November 23, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Pfizer Reaches Takeover Deal With Allergan .

The other unit would contain older products at or near the end of their patent lives.\nThe largest U.S. drugmaker said last month it was in “preliminary friendly discussions” about combining with Allergan. An acquisition of Allergan, which is incorporated in Dublin and run from New Jersey, would give Pfizer a low-tax legal address abroad and valuable drugs like the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment. The companies could agree on a deal by Thanksgiving, celebrated in the U.S. on Nov. 26, people familiar with the matter said last week.\nPfizer is led by Ian Read, 62, who has been CEO since 2010. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion and Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur declined to comment.\nThe idea of a Pfizer breakup was popularized in 2012, when a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested that the company might be worth more in pieces than as a whole. Since then, whether or not the company would pull the lever to do so has been the subject of constant speculation, though Pfizer has said it couldn’t happen until at least 2017. Allergan itself is in the process of a split under Saunders’s leadership, after agreeing in July to sell its generics business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nSaunders, 45, spent his first dozen years in the health-care industry largely in compliance positions. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and the Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, he became a CEO for the first time in 2010 with Bausch & Lomb Inc. Three years later he sold the eye-care company to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. for $8.7 billion.\nAfter Bausch & Lomb, activist investor Carl Icahn endorsed Saunders becoming CEO of Forest Laboratories Inc. Soon after, Actavis Plc bought Forest and Saunders became CEO of the combined entity, with the acquirer’s chief executive Paul Bisaro assuming the role of executive chairman. They both remain in place at Allergan, whose name Actavis took after their 2014 merger agreement.\nRead took the helm at Pfizer after a turbulent period for the drugmaker that ended with the ouster of CEO Jeff Kindler. A chemical engineer by training, he joined Pfizer in 1978 as an accountant, then rose through the drugmaker’s ranks to run its worldwide pharmaceutical businesses. Since Dec. 5, 2010, when Read was named CEO, the stock has doubled from $16.72 to more than $33.\nSince taking over, he has overhauled the company’s R&D operations, cutting struggling programs like allergy and respiratory drugs to focus on cancer, neurology, inflammation, vaccines and immunology.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.322335-06
42	2	Glaxo Bulls Awaken With Calls as Pfizer Merger Chatter Escalates ...	http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-28/glaxo-bulls-awaken-with-calls-as-pfizer-merger-chatter-escalates	May 28, 2015 ... “A lot of this is down to rumors about a merger with Pfizer,” said Kari Olsen, ... \nWith Glaxo's new chairman saying this month he wants to retain ...	12	\N	Sofia Horta e Costa\nOptions traders are getting busy with a U.K. stock they have rarely paid attention to.\nVolume in GlaxoSmithKline Plc contracts surged to the highest level since 2007 this month, with traders paying record prices for bullish options relative to bearish ones. All that after the stock lost $11 billion in value over two months.\nOptions have become the tool of choice for speculators as analysts flagged the company as a potential acquisition for Pfizer Inc. As deal chatter increases, so does optimism that Glaxo will give in to pressure to shake up management.\n“A lot of this is down to rumors about a merger with Pfizer,” said Kari Olsen, a sales trader at Tavira Monaco Sam. “There is also talk that if the CEO does go, the stock can spike up some 10 percent on the back of people thinking that the company can then start restructuring and sell some assets.”\nAlmost 800 Glaxo options changed hands on average each day this month. That’s 17 percent more than in April and compares with an average of about 300 contracts daily in the past two years. Calls that profit with a 9.6 percent jump by December are the most owned of all. The stock lost 11 percent since its April high.\nChief Executive Officer Andrew Witty is struggling to revive revenue growth lagging behind competitors. U.S sales have been sluggish, investors have criticized the company’s drug pipeline, and a bribery scandal in China led to a fine of 297 million pounds ($455 million). With Glaxo’s new chairman saying this month he wants to retain Witty, speculation is growing that a takeover is what would boost the shares.\nFailed Bid\nPurchasing Glaxo would benefit Pfizer, according to a Deutsche Bank AG note last week. The U.S. drugmaker, which failed to purchase AstraZeneca Plc last year, hasn’t announced a bid for London-based Glaxo or indicated an interest. Analysts also mentioned Shire Plc and Actavis Plc as potential targets.\nThe stock climbed 0.5 percent at 10:52 a.m. in London.\nSpokespeople for Glaxo and Pfizer declined to comment on the options trading.\nFor Ben Kelly, an event-driven analyst at Louis Capital Markets, a Pfizer-Glaxo merger is unlikely for many of the reasons that the pursuit of AstraZeneca failed, including potential changes to U.S. tax laws making inversion deals less appealing. Glaxo also has a significant chunk of its workforce in the U.K., where the government would seek assurances regarding job cuts.\nNational Champion\n“Glaxo is a U.K. national champion -- a bid for the company would cause a rehash of all that political and nationalistic furor,” Kelly said. “There would also be political pressure against a deal in the U.S. as it’s very clear there would be a strong tax-inversion rationale, and we have elections coming up there next year.”\nUsing options might be the safest way to play a rebound in Glaxo shares, which are among May’s worst-performing European health-care stocks, according to Tavira Monaco’s Olsen. The number of Glaxo calls outstanding has almost doubled since the March expiration, compared with a 50 percent growth in puts.\n“Glaxo has been quite weak lately,” Olsen said. “Although going outright long the stock may still be too risky for some investors, using options to play any upside on Glaxo makes sense. You don’t have too much to lose.”	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.910247-06

"The proposed acquisition of Hospira demonstrates our commitment to ... "In \naddition, Hospira's business aligns well with our new commercial ...	3	\N	Pfizer to Acquire Hospira\nTransaction will significantly enhance Pfizer’s Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) Business Transaction valued at $90 per Hospira share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion Expected to be immediately accretive upon closing; $0.10-$0.12 accretion expected in first full year after close with additional accretion anticipated thereafter\nThursday, February 5, 2015 - 7:01am\nNEW YORK, New York, and LAKE FOREST, Illinois – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Hospira, Inc. (NYSE: HSP) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Hospira, the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, for $90 a share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. The Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the merger, which is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing, accretive by $0.10 - $0.12 per share for the first full year following the close of the transaction with additional accretion anticipated thereafter.\n"The proposed acquisition of Hospira demonstrates our commitment to prudently deploy capital to create shareholder value and deliver incremental revenue and EPS growth in the near-term," said Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. "In addition, Hospira’s business aligns well with our new commercial structure and is an excellent strategic fit for our Global Established Pharmaceutical business, which will benefit from a significantly enhanced product portfolio in growing markets. Coupled with Pfizer’s global reach, Hospira is expected to drive greater sustainability for our Global Established Pharmaceutical business over the long term."\nThis strategically complementary combination will add a growing revenue stream and a platform for growth for Pfizer’s GEP business. The expanded portfolio of sterile injectable pharmaceuticals, composed of Hospira’s broad generic sterile injectables product line, including acute care and oncology injectables, with a number of differentiated presentations, as well as its biosimilars portfolio, combined with GEP’s branded sterile injectables, including anti-infectives, anti-inflammatories and cytotoxics, will create a leading global sterile injectables business. The combination also reinforces GEP’s growth strategy to build a broad portfolio of biosimilars in Pfizer’s therapeutic areas of strength through the addition of Hospira’s portfolio that includes several marketed biosimilars. Pfizer will also use its existing commercial capabilities, global scale, scientific expertise and world class development capabilities to significantly expand the reach of Hospira’s products, which are currently distributed primarily in the United States, to Europe and key emerging markets, where GEP has a significant presence.\n"The addition of Hospira has the potential to fundamentally improve the growth trajectory of the Global Established Pharmaceutical business, vault it into a leadership position in the large and growing off-patent sterile injectables marketplace by combining the specialized talent and capabilities of both companies, including enhanced manufacturing, and advance its goal to be among the world’s most preeminent biosimilars providers," said John Young, group president, Pfizer Global Established Pharmaceutical business. "We're excited to combine Hospira’s expertise and key talent with that of Pfizer to create a leading global business that will deliver an even broader portfolio of important and life-saving sterile injectable medicines to patients around the world."\n"The Pfizer-Hospira combination is an excellent strategic fit, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage the complementary strengths of our robust portfolios and rich pipelines," said F. Michael Ball, Chief Executive Officer, Hospira. "I want to recognize and thank our 19,000 employees around the world for their tireless efforts to deliver more affordable healthcare solutions, increase patient access to high-quality care and drive sustained growth for our shareholders."\nBoth sterile injectables and biosimilars are large and growing categories. The global marketplace value for generic sterile injectables is estimated to be $70 billion in 2020. The global marketplace for biosimilars is estimated to be approximately $20 billion in 2020.\nPfizer expects to finance the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt, with approximately two-thirds of the value financed from cash and one-third from debt. In addition, Pfizer anticipates the transaction to deliver $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions and approval of Hospira's shareholders, and is expected to close in the second half of 2015.\nPfizer's financial advisors for the transaction were Guggenheim Securities, J.P. Morgan and Lazard, with Ropes & Gray LLP acting as its legal advisor and Clifford Chance LLP advising on international regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley served as Hospira’s financial advisor, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates served as its legal advisor.\nAbout Pfizer:\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

43	2	Pfizer, Allergan set to merge	http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/22/pfizer.html	Nov 23, 2015 ... Pfizer secured formal board approval on Sunday for its acquisition of ... rose 3.4 \npercent to $312.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.	13	\N	SHARES\nPfizer secured formal board approval on Sunday for its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan for more than $150 billion, a deal that will create the world's biggest drug maker, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe deal, the largest ever in the healthcare sector, will be announced on Monday and is sure to draw political ire in a U.S. presidential election year because Pfizer would redomicile to Ireland, where Allergan is registered, in a so-called "inversion" that would slash its corporate tax rate.\nIt will also reignite debate in the pharmaceutical industry over the role of research and development, with Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, a prolific dealmaker and a skeptic of in-house drug discovery, joining the combined company in a position to influence its strategy.\nThe deal would involve Pfizer paying with 11.3 of its shares for each Allergan share, the people said. There will also be a small cash component, accounting for less than 10 percent of the value of the deal, the people said.\nPfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read, 62, will be CEO of the combined company, with Allergan's CEO Brent Saunders, 45, serving in a very senior role focused on operations and the integration, the people added.\nRead More Pfizer, Allergan in final innings of all stock deal\nSaunders will also have a seat on the combined company's board, one of the people said.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the terms of the deal are not yet public. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.\nColossus\nThe deal would create a pharmaceutical colossus with annual sales of more than $60 billion, putting the merged group well ahead of No. 2 U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, which has annual sales of about $40 billion.\nWidely used Pfizer drugs such as Lipitor, Viagra and nerve pain treatment Lyrica would be brought together with Allergan's Namenda memory loss treatment, Restasis dry eye medication and other leading eye-care brands.\nIt would be the biggest merger of the year, topping beer maker Anheuser-Busch InBev's proposed $107 billion takeover of SABMiller Plc. And it would realize Read's longtime ambition of an inversion deal that would get Pfizer out from under the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate, among the world's highest. The tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 percent.\nPfizer's talks with Allergan come more than a year after the U.S. firm abandoned a bid to acquire AstraZeneca and move its tax headquarters to Britain.\nThe U.S. Treasury last year, and again last week, updated its rules on inversions to make it harder for companies to avoid U.S. taxes by moving overseas. But experts have said these moves would do little to prevent Pfizer from inverting.\nAlthough Pfizer has decried the high U.S. corporate tax rate, it has minimized its U.S. taxes for years by selling its drug patents to overseas subsidiaries and then using them to make drugs that are sold back to U.S. affiliates. While generating big profit margins for its overseas arm, the practice has allowed Pfizer to report losses on its higher-taxed U.S. business in each of the past five years.\nMany industry analysts and investors believe Pfizer could be bulking up with Allergan's fast-growing brands as a prelude to splitting by 2017 into two companies - one selling high-margin branded drugs and one selling inexpensive generics that have dragged down Pfizer results over the past few years.\nRead, a trained accountant, has said Pfizer could decide on such a split by late 2016, after it completes separate financial analyses of the two businesses.\nPfizer's $15 billion purchase earlier this year of hospital products maker Hospira, which sells generic injectable drugs and is developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines, was widely seen as a move to make its generics business more attractive ahead of a sale.\nAllergan has agreed to sell its own wide array of generics by early next year to Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.\nSpeculation has been rife on Wall Street whether Read or Saunders would take the helm of the combined company, and whether Saunders would be content to play second fiddle to Read, who became Pfizer CEO in 2010 after more than 30 years with the company.\nSaunders has had a meteoric rise in the industry over the past five years, turning around eye-care company Bausch & Lomb and also leading Forest Laboratories and Swiss drugmaker Actavis, which took the Allergan name after acquiring it this year.\nEarlier, he won plaudits for helping Schering-Plough overcome serious quality-control problems and then leading its integration with Merck & Co. Due to his rapid ascent and moves, Saunders has not presided over start to-finish development of a drug, a process that can take 12 years or longer.\nAnd unlike large drugmakers who conduct costly discovery research, Saunders has said that it makes more sense economically to acquire medicines that have already shown promise in human trials.\nBut in a recent interview, Saunders said he would be willing to put a higher emphasis on drug discovery if it makes sense for his company. Pfizer shares closed little changed on Friday at $32.18, while Allergan's rose 3.4 percent to $312.46, both on the New York Stock Exchange.\nPlease enter a valid email address	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.914986-06
37	2	Pfizer Chief Defends Merger With Allergan as Good for U.S. - The ...	http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/24/business/dealbook/pfizer-allergan-merger-inversion.html	Nov 23, 2015 ... Pfizer and Allergan Reach $150 Billion Merger Deal NOV. .... said the news of the \nmerger “only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive ...	7	\N	In phone calls to Washington lawmakers and Obama administration officials, the chief executive of the largest drug maker in the nation had a surprising message: A deal that would allow the company to move its headquarters to Ireland was actually good for the United States.\nThe Scottish-born chief executive of Pfizer , Ian C. Read, told them that a merger with Allergan, the maker of Botox that is based in Dublin, would significantly cut Pfizer’s tax bill and give it more cash that it could invest in the United States and ultimately add jobs, according to people briefed on the calls. He made the calls in recent days as the two companies were hammering out a $152 billion deal .\nMonday’s announcement of the deal — the biggest merger in 15 years — has revived a fierce public debate over whether mergers that allow a company in the United States to relocate to a lower-tax country are, in fact, good for America.\nPfizer, founded by German immigrants in Brooklyn in 1849, is becoming the biggest company yet to shed its American citizenship to lower its taxes. While not structured as what is known as an inversion, it achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad. Continue reading the main story\nRecord Year of Deal-Making\nGiant impending deals announced this year include:\nAn aborted bid by Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca of Britain in an inversion last year set off a public uproar — leading President Obama to call such deals “unpatriotic” — and prompted moves by the Treasury to curb them.\nThe latest merger announcement has stirred a similar outcry across the political spectrum.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nDonald J. Trump, a Republican candidate for president, said in a statement: “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting. Our politicians should be ashamed.”\nYet the two companies and their advisers are betting that the Treasury Department will not be able to come up with new rules to block the union, and that Congress will fail to revamp the tax code before the merger’s expected close late next year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnd as Mr. Read has made clear publicly and privately, his main priority is doing well by his shareholders — and that means finding a way to compete with huge foreign rivals that enjoy much lower tax rates.\n“We’ve assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of the patients and to bring value to shareholders,” Mr. Read said on Monday on a call with analysts. “That is our obligation.”\nMr. Read and those close to him have noted that Pfizer, based in New York, has been upfront about its intentions. Even after its takeover campaign for AstraZeneca collapsed, the Pfizer chief made no secret of his desire to try again, while criticizing a tax code that he said leaves his company fighting with one hand tied behind its back.\nThe drug maker, which manufactured penicillin during World War II, has complained that its tax rate last year was 26 percent, compared with the approximately 5 percent that Allergan’s predecessor company paid during that same time.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBigger international rivals, from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of Britain to Novartis of Switzerland, also pay substantially less in taxes, potentially letting them win takeover contests with higher bids.\nPerhaps more important, Pfizer kept overseas $74 billion in profits that were earned abroad last year, because bringing them home would have racked up billions of dollars in taxes.\nSince the AstraZeneca bid, the Obama administration has introduced new rules that have made it harder for companies to do inversion deals, scuttling efforts by companies like AbbVie , a large drug maker based in Illinois, to relocate abroad.\nFrom the beginning of their deal discussions nearly three months ago, Pfizer and Allergan agreed that the best way forward was to forgo an inversion altogether, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Instead, Allergan would serve as the buyer despite being substantially smaller.\nMindful of the sensitivity in Washington, Pfizer included in its advisory team the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company, whose vice chairman is Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.\nWhile Mr. Cantor will not lobby lawmakers, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, he has advised the company on political aspects of the deal and maintains friendly contact with his former colleagues.\nDespite the political uproar, the merger is not expected to encounter significant resistance from the American regulator that will review the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the people with direct knowledge of the deal.\nA spokesman for the Treasury Department said on Monday that it did not comment on specific transactions. Still, the department has clearly signaled its distaste for deals that move a company’s tax home.\nThe particular design of Monday’s transaction, however, effectively shields Pfizer and Allergan from the administration’s efforts to curb such deals. Continue reading the main story\nRelated Tax Inversion Coverage\nWhen the Treasury Department announced its latest rule changes on Thursday, advisers to both companies sat down to review the changes — and quickly went back to work on their negotiations, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n“Treasury’s proposals don’t touch them,” said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant who examined the deal.\nPresidential candidates offered swift condemnation of the transaction all the same.\nSuch transactions, Mrs. Clinton said, “take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system.”\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.”\nYet others said a broader tax overhaul was needed.\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the news of the merger “only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive nature of the U.S. tax code.”\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nExecutives at both Pfizer and Allergan are betting that Congress will continue to be conflicted about how to deal with inversions. Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have called for a comprehensive regulatory overhaul and have shown reluctance to focus on particular companies.\n“It’s not clear what Washington’s wishes are,” said one person close to the transaction. “We tried to tell them to fix our tax system. It’s not like this is a surprise.”\nAt the same time, both Mr. Read and his counterpart at Allergan, Brenton L. Saunders, have emphasized that the deal isn’t being done just to cut taxes.\nBoth executives contend the deal gives Pfizer access to fast-growing treatments in the eye care and dermatology space, as well as brands like Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm.\nMoreover, it will give Pfizer enough size and product diversity to break itself up in three years’ time, dividing itself into a company focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another built on more mature treatments that face competition from generic competitors. The company said on Monday that it would decide in late 2018 whether to proceed with a split.\nBuying Allergan will bring more fast-growing treatments to Pfizer’s portfolio. That would complement Pfizer’s $17 billion acquisition of the generic drug maker Hospira earlier this year, meant to bulk up its so-called established treatments division.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Pfizer would essentially pay $363.63 for each Allergan share, representing a nearly 30 percent premium to Allergan’s share price in late October before news emerged that they were in talks. That values the acquisition at $152 billion. Including debt and subtracting cash, the deal is worth $160 billion.\nAfter the transaction, Pfizer shareholders are expected to own about 56 percent of the combined company, with the remaining 44 percent owned by Allergan shareholders. Mr. Read will be chief executive of the new Pfizer P.L.C., to be based in Dublin, while Mr. Saunders will become president, and will be in line to take over one of the company’s businesses if and when it decides to break itself up.\nInvestors appeared unimpressed. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent, while Pfizer’s ended down 2.6 percent.\nThe expected cost savings of about $2 billion over the first three years announced after the deal was made were well below most analysts’ projections. And the $5 billion in planned stock buybacks that also were announced on Monday were in line with Pfizer’s previous efforts.\nSome analysts still regarded the deal positively, so far as it ties into Pfizer’s goals.\n“Allergan was easier to get done as a friendly deal in terms of getting a structure done and management roles done,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies.\nTo some involved in the deal, the tax savings are all that matters. “If the tax stuff went away entirely, the deal would be off,” a person briefed on Mr. Read’s thinking said.\nLiz Moyer, Chad Bray and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.\nA version of this article appears in print on November 24, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Chief of Pfizer Defends Merger as Good for U.S. Order Reprints | Today's Paper | Subscribe	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.308421-06

Pfizer stock began to trade higher, before falling about 2 percent. Both stocks were initially halted immediately after the news.\n"Under any potential scenario with Pfizer, Allergan remains strongly committed to complete the proposed divestment of its global generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and expects the generics divestiture transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016," the statement said.\nAllergan said it would make another announcement "when appropriate."\nPfizer also confirmed the talks in a statement released on Thursday. "Pfizer will not comment on speculation regarding the terms of a potential transaction," the company said.\nThe two companies are the latest pharmaceutical companies to start early dealmaking talks . Such a deal could mark the zenith of the industry's megamerger trend.\nPfizer headquarters in New York.\nThere has already been close to $850 billion worth of deals in the sector made this year, as cash-rich companies either try to fix their pipelines or save on U.S. taxes by doing a tax inversion, where they exploit loopholes in America's tax system by buying smaller rivals based abroad and redomiciling themselves.\nThe health-care sector has accounted for close to a quarter of U.S.- focused mergers and acquisitions in 2015, according to Dealogic figures, making it the biggest sector for dealmaking in the country this year.\nThis also suggests that attempts by the U.S. government to crack down on tax inversion, after a wave of mergers and acquisitions in 2014-5 were partly motivated by tax reasons, have been futile.\nThe company currently known as Allergan, which is headquartered in Ireland, was created when rival Actavis bought the company last year.\nThe Botox maker, which marked its fifth M&A deal in three years with the merger, has become synonymous with the frenetic pace of dealmaking in the industry.\nThe company is currently led by Brent Saunders, a veteran dealmaker in the pharma space.\nLast year, Pfizer made a $118 billion bid for U.K. pharma company AstraZeneca, but a bid for the maker of Botox, which currently has a market value of $113 billion, could potentially be even bigger.\nFurther down the line, if a deal transpires, it could also mean that a breakup of Pfizer into one company that sells medicines still under patent protection, and another for so-called generic drugs, could be in the cards.\nAnalysts led by Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin have speculated for months that 2016 or 2017 could see a seismic breakup at the company. In March, Rubin said that Ian Read, the chief executive of Pfizer, seemed open to "going further with separations."\n— CNBC's David Faber contributed to this report\nPlease enter a valid email address\nTo learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.904465-06

(Spencer Platt)\nMichael Hiltzik Contact Reporter The Economy Hub\nA corporate tax dodge known as "inversions" had a moment in the spotlight about a year ago, when a number of such high-profile mergers got U.S. Treasury officials, politicians and voters steaming. \nInversions are mergers in which a big U.S. company buys a smaller foreign company and reincorporates in the foreign land to take advantage of its lower corporate tax rate. Following the public uproar and a tightening of Treasury rules--and a public denunciation  from President Obama --inversions ebbed, for a bit. (We reported on the inversion craze here ,  here  and here .)\nThe shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return. - Pfizer Chairman Ian Read\nBut a huge merger being discussed by Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan has revived the specter of these tax-advantaged flights of corporate assets from U.S. shores. The deal, which the companies say is under "preliminary" discussion, would create the world's largest drugmaker, valued at more than $300 billion.\nIt also would lower Pfizer's effective U.S. tax rate--though by how much isn't clear, since many critics think the company's declared effective rate of 25.5% in 2014 is vastly overstated. The key may be that the deal would relieve Pfizer of the potential tax burden of as much as $148 billion  in overseas earnings it has stashed overseas. That money would be subject to U.S. taxes if brought home, but might be permanently sheltered under the terms of an inversion merger.\nThe Inversion Craze\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004.\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004. (Congressional Research Service)\nPfizer has been among the nation's most aggressive exploiters of U.S. tax breaks by booking business expenses in the U.S. and shifting income abroad, according to critics such as Americans for Tax Fairness. In a report  issued this month, the organization asserted that Pfizer's effective tax rate last year actually was only 7.5%, not 25.5%. The discrepancy was due to "accounting fiction," including the reporting of "deferred taxes" that the company is unlikely to pay in the future. \nPfizer maintains that its income policies and tax reporting comply with all government rules and regulations. No one has shown they don't.\nWhat's unclear is why Pfizer would aggressively overstate its tax bite, since that means understating its earnings. Among the possibilities, experts say, is that the company fears that revealing its inordinately low real tax rate might attract unwelcome attention from pharmaceutical and tax regulators. Or it might be building up a reserve of deferred taxes to apply to any overseas earnings it eventually repatriates to the U.S., whether under orders from U.S. tax authorities or voluntarily, as part of a partial amnesty.\nClose loopholes that let U.S. firms avoid taxes by using inversions Michael Hiltzik It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... (Michael Hiltzik)\nInversions aren't illegal, though they have been politically touchy. Pfizer Chairman Ian Read acknowledged as much during a conference call with securities analysts  Oct. 27, but said the "political ramifications" wouldn't stop him from taking any step he judged to be in his shareholders' and employees' interests. "The shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return," he said, "and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust, successful company."\nThe political issues can't be dismissed so lightly, however. Obama took aim  last year at companies he called "corporate deserters--a small but growing group of big corporations that are fleeing the country to get out of paying taxes.... They’re declaring they’re based someplace else even though most of their operations are here."  \nA tightening of regulations by the Treasury Department last year succeeded in quashing several large inversion deals. Among other things, tax officials are certain to be on the lookout for any merger-related maneuvers that seem aimed at reducing the percentage of Pfizer shareholders still holding interests in the merged companies. That's a key metric followed by the Treasury. These steps could include spinoffs of existing businesses or stock buybacks that pay off shareholders with cash.\nA Pfizer deal might also spur Congress and the White House to finally make a permanent deal on corporate taxes--which could be good or bad for companies like Pfizer, depending on the terms. \nThat effort should start with a two-year moratorium on all inversions "to reduce the hemorrhaging," suggests Edward D. Kleinbard , a USC law professor whose role as a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation certifies him as one of our leading experts on the corporate tax.\nKleinbard argues that the elements of a new corporate tax structure have long been clear on both sides of the partisan aisle. "The scope of disagreement between [House Speaker Paul] Ryan and President Obama is so small that they could work out the bullet points in the course of a weekend," he says. \nThe points would include reducing the corporate tax rate, which tops out at 35%, to somewhere around 25% while eliminating a host of corporate tax rates and taxing earnings on a territorial basis--that is, levying U.S. tax chiefly on income earned within the U.S., perhaps with a lower but minimum tax on foreign earnings. That would encourage companies to bring foreign earnings back to the U.S., where they could be invested in the U.S. economy.\nSuch changes might not quell the incessant whining by American companies about our high corporate tax rate--although, as Pfizer shows, they rarely pay anything approaching the statutory rate. But in practical terms it might quell their appetite for merger deals that make sense largely as tax maneuvers. American business ingenuity is almost limitless, and it might do everyone good for it to be applied to developing useful new drugs and other products, instead of tax schemes.\nKeep up to date with the Economy Hub.

Pfizer investors will get one share of the new company for each of their shares or a portion of payment in cash from a $6 billion to $12 billion payment that will be made as part of the merger.\nThe transaction is currently valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of roughly $160 billion, including debt, based on the $32.18 per share closing price of Pfizer stock on Nov. 20, the companies said.\nThe deal terms call for the companies to combine under Allergan, which will be renamed Pfizer and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the PFE ticker symbol. The new combination would retain Allergan's legal and tax residency in Ireland. Pfizer would have its global operational headquarters in New York and its principal executive offices in Ireland.\nIan Read, Pfizer's CEO and chairman, will hold both those roles in the newly combined company. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will serve as president and chief operating officer of the new company.\nAdditionally, Pfizer's board is expected to have 15 directors, including all of Pfizer's 11 current directors and four current directors from Allergan.\nAs a result of the transaction, Pfizer said it plans to make a decision about a possible separation of the combined company's innovative and established operations into separate firms by the end of 2018.\nThe agreement is expected to face regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, and shareholders of both companies must vote on the transaction. Company officials said they expect the deal to close in the second half of 2016.\nThe agreement comes four days after the Obama administration stepped up its attack on corporate tax inversions — transactions in which a U.S. company reincorporates in a lower tax nation in a bid to cut its future tax bills while its leaving domestic operations in place.\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the restrictions, the second targeting inversions since 2014, were aimed at preventing inversions from eroding the nation's federal tax base. Congressional Democrats have generally backed the White House position. Republicans have said inversions should be addressed as part of a broader federal tax reform to lower the 39% U.S. top tax rate on business, the world's highest levy.\nPfizer officials predicted the Pfizer-Allergan combination would have an effective tax rate of 17% to 18% starting in the first year after the deal closes — well below the 25% rate the U.S. firm currently reports in financial filings.\nRead also said the deal would give Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," a reference to billions of dollars the company holds overseas because shifting the money to the U.S. would subject the funds to a substantial federal tax bite.\nHowever, the Treasury rules are not expected to affect the merger, in part because the transaction is structured to have Dublin-based Allergan, with a market capitalization of roughly $122 billion, acquire New York City-headquartered Pfizer, which has a market capitalization of approximately $200 billion.\nAllergan shareholders would hold an estimated 44% of the newly combined company's shares, with Pfizer investors holding 56%, company officials said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts. The level of Pfizer ownership falls below the 60% legal threshold needed for the deal to be officially deemed a tax inversion under the federal tax code and considered subject to the Treasury rules, said independent tax expert Robert Willens.\nTreasury officials declined to comment on the merger.\nRead pointedly referenced business industry and political discussions about the inversion issue and the wider question of federal tax reform as he and other Pfizer and Allergan officials fielded questions from financial analysts.\n"While reform progresses, we've assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of patients and to bring value to shareholders," said Read. "That is our obligation."\nSpeaking more generally about the merger, he said the agreement would facilitate discovery and development of new medications for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continue investments in the U.S.\nSaunders characterized the deal as a "highly strategic, value-enhancing transaction" and said it would give Allergan new or increased access to dozens of markets, including Japan and China.\n2434 CONNECT TWEET 301 LINKEDIN 123 COMMENT EMAIL MORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1jfM6qI	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.934112-06

And it may also reignite concern about the extent to which drug discovery will remain an important part of the pharmaceutical playbook.\nThe merger is the latest in a string of such deals over the past couple of years that have transformed the pharmaceutical industry at a time when drug prices have come under increased pressure  and the push to develop new medicines remains costly and risky. The deal, which comes after weeks of talks, would be the biggest merger ever among drug makers, exceeding the $116 billion that Pfizer paid to buy Warner-Lambert in 2000.\nThe combined company would be run by Ian Read, the current Pfizer chief executive, while Brent Saunders, who currently heads Allergan, would reportedly take a senior role. Its portfolio of products would include a variety of big-selling drugs and vaccines used to treat pneumonia, cancer, eye disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, among many other diseases.\nA key feature of the deal is a lower tax rate thanks to a so-called tax inversion. While Pfizer is based in New York, the combined companies will establish legal tax headquarters in Dublin, where Allergan is based. The corporate tax rate there is 12.5 percent compared with 35 percent in the US. Such moves, which are popular in the pharmaceutical industry, have caused political tumult.\nThe merger terms were first reported by Reuters and the Wall Street Journal .\nThe deal comes just days after the US Treasury Department issued new rules in hopes of thwarting more tax inversions. This was the second time in 14 months the Obama administration took such a step. The first time followed an unsuccessful effort by Pfizer to buy AstraZeneca, which is based in the UK. Tax experts believe the rules are unlikely to deter inversions, but further government action is possible.\nThe merger between Pfizer and Allergan, meanwhile, could facilitate a long-planned move by Pfizer to split itself into two businesses — one that focuses on developing new medicines and another that emphasizes the sale of older medicines that have lost patent protection. Pfizer has openly considered the strategy for the past years as it faced declining revenues.\nAt the same time, the deal may raise questions about investment in research and the development of new drugs. Although Saunders has acknowledged that research remains a fundamental part of the pharmaceutical enterprise, he has not embraced the concept that drug discovery provides a sufficient return on capital.\nEd Silverman can be reached at ed.silverman@statnews.com Follow Ed on Twitter @Pharmalot	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.949535-06

The merger would create the world's largest drugmaker with high-profile products \nsuch as Botox, Lipitor and Viagra.	19	\N	Pfizer and Allergan’s $160 billion pharmaceutical merger puts new twist on tax-avoiding inversions November 23, 2015 11:17 PM\nBy Jim Puzzanghera and Samantha Masunaga / Los Angeles Times\nPharmaceutical giants Pfizer Inc. and Allergan on Monday announced a $160 billion merger that would create the world’s largest drugmaker with high-profile products such as Botox, Lipitor and Viagra, while increasing pressure on Washington policymakers to address corporate tax policy because the deal would shelter the new firm’s global earnings.\nAlthough New York-based Pfizer is the larger company, the deal is structured so that Allergan technically is the purchaser — a new twist on the controversial tax-avoidance tactic known as inversion.\nThe move allows the new firm — which would take the name Pfizer Plc and be headed by its current chief executive, Ian Read — to be headquartered for tax purposes in Dublin, where Allergan already is located, to take advantage of the nation’s lower corporate-tax rate.\nThe maneuver is a variation on the conventional inversion, in which a U.S. firm buys a smaller foreign competitor in a lower-tax nation and shifts the merged company’s headquarters there.\nIn February, local generic drugmaker Mylan completed an inversion when it bought a major portion of Abbott Laboratories’ generics business and reincorporated in the Netherlands.\nMylan CEO Heather Bresch has said the company, which continues to be run from its operational headquarters in Cecil, needed an inversion to remain competitive with other drug makers that pursued the same strategy.\nThe combination could have ramifications around the globe, pushing up drug prices and spurring more such deals in the fast-consolidating health care sector and other fields.\nIt is also increasing the election-year backlash from U.S. politicians who have been blasting drugmakers recently over medicine prices that can exceed $100,000 a year.\nPfizer and Allergan said their deal would lead to an effective tax rate for the new company of about 17 percent to 18 percent. Pfizer’s effective tax rate last year was 25.5 percent, according to a regulatory filing.\nPresident Barack Obama and members of Congress from both political parties have complained about companies using the maneuver to lower how much they pay in U.S. taxes. The Treasury Department has taken steps, including several announced last week, to try to make inversions more difficult.\nBut those changes weren’t enough to keep Pfizer and Allergan from merging in the largest inversion-type deal so far by a U.S. company.\n“The proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world,” Mr. Read said.\n“Through this combination, Pfizer will have greater financial flexibility that will facilitate our continued discovery and development of new innovative medicines for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continued investment in the United States, while also enabling our pursuit of business development opportunities on a more competitive footing within our industry,” he said.\nThe deal will enable the combined company to pour around $9 billion a year into research on new treatments, Mr. Read said. That includes work on cures for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, cancer and other difficult-to-treat illnesses. It costs upwards of $1.5 billion to get a new drug approved.\nMr. Read said the companies believed the deal as structured would not be hindered by the Obama administration’s anti-inversion steps. And he said lowering Pfizer’s taxes wasn’t the only motivation.\n“I want to stress that we’re not doing this transaction simply as a tax transaction,” Mr. Read told investors in a conference call Monday.\nMr. Obama and Democrats have called inversions unpatriotic and have sought changes to make them more difficult. Many Republicans also have decried inversions but said the solution is to significantly lower the U.S. corporate tax rate to reduce the incentive to reincorporate overseas.\nBipartisan efforts to overhaul the corporate tax code have stalled and legislation is unlikely until after next year’s presidential election.\nSeveral presidential candidates weighed in on the deal.\n“This proposed merger, and so-called ‘inversions’ by other companies, will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag,” Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement, calling on Congress to act and force large corporations to pay “their fair share” of taxes.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, called on the Obama administration to block the deal, which in effect turns one of America’s largest corporations into a foreign company.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Mr. Sanders said. “It also would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas.”\nAnd Republican candidate Donald Trump said in a statement: “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting.”\nRep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., said the deal “highlights the need for Congress to take action on inversions,” which he said have cost the U.S. government tens of billions of dollars in tax revenue.\nJamie Court, president of advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said the consolidation of two pharmaceutical giants could lead to higher drug prices for consumers because of decreased competition.\n“Certain patients are going to not only see elevated prices, but potentially a loss of choice,” he said.\nThe deal values Allergan at $363.63 per share, about 30 percent more than its price when reports of a deal first surfaced last month.\nAllergan shareholders will get 11.3 shares of the new company for each of their shares. Pfizer shareholders will get one share of the new company’s stock for each of their shares.\nThe merger needs the go-ahead from shareholders of both companies. After completion of the deal, which also must be approved by U.S. and European regulators, Pfizer shareholders would own 56 percent of the combined company.\nThe new firm would have its global headquarters in New York but its principal executive offices would be in Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. The U.S. has a 35 percent corporate tax rate, the highest of any developed economy.\nAllergan has about 2,100 employees in the Los Angeles-area city of Irvine, where it was formerly headquartered, and an additional 300 in nearby Corona out of a global workforce totaling 30,000. Pfizer, with revenue of $49.6 billion last year, employs 78,300 worldwide.\nWhile new regulations issued starting last year have made inversions more difficult, the Pfizer-Allergan deal is a foreign acquisition that avoids those rules, said Larry Harding, vice chairman of Radius, a firm that helps U.S. companies operate overseas.\n“This is has been what people are more worried about. If the inversions become harder and the tax savings still make sense, they’ll just do it as an out-and-out acquisition,” Mr. Harding said.\n“It’s definitely an interesting inflection point and has ratcheted up the issue,” he said.\nAs the largest inversion-type deal so far, Pfizer and Allergan could face regulatory problems in Washington, said Maxim Jacobs, an analyst at Edison Investment Research.\n“Although the Pfizer-Allergan deal appears to have been consummated and is attractive to both sides, the U.S. regulatory reaction to this very high-profile merger remains an unknown and may very well be negative due to the size of the tax inversion,” he said.\nThe deal has a breakup fee of as much as $3.5 billion, which both companies have the right to exercise, they said.\nCorporate mergers and acquisitions this year are on pace to break the record of $4.6 trillion set in 2007, according to Dealogic, which tracks the market.\nThe trend is largely being driven by companies looking for acquisitions in the same industry, or close to it, so that they can gain market share, new products and geographic reach in sectors where they already compete.\nHealth care, in particular, has seen a spree of takeovers as providers, insurers, pharmaceutical makers and drugstores reposition themselves for industry changes spawned by the federal Affordable Care Act.\nBut critics have raised concerns about the increased number of takeovers. In the case of health care, some have said that as the number of players in each sector shrinks, consumers will have fewer choices and prices will rise. The Pfizer-Allergan deal drew such criticism amid the ongoing debate about higher drug prices.\nStaff writer Patricia Sabatini, Associated Press and The Washington Post contributed.\nFirst Published November 23, 2015 10:09 AM	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:36.944963-06

Merger and acquisition activity by Pfizer was not \nunexpected. 'Pfizer needed to replenish its basket of approved ...	24	\N	27 November 2015 Anthony King\nPharma giant Pfizer is to combine with Allergan in a $160 billion (£106 billion) mega-merger. The deal is being positioned as Irish-based Allergan taking over Pfizer, with the merged entity resident in Ireland for tax purposes. This will save billions of dollars in future tax bills, but do little for new drug discovery.\nPfizer boss Ian Read claims the deal is motivated by more than just tax, but analysts and politicians are unconvinced © Matt Dunham/AP/Press Association Images\nPfizer, which will retain its operational headquarters in the US, flagged expected savings of $2 billion from operating expenses, with a third coming from R&D. Pfizer today invests $7 billion in R&D, the vast majority of which is in the US.\n‘Pfizer said last quarter that it was going to reduce all costs. One of the easiest to reduce is the tax liability. That is what it has done,’ says Steve Brozak , president of WBB Securities in San Diego, US. The move will bulk up revenue and cut expenses but will do nothing to add to the drug pipeline. The deal sidesteps the US treasury’s tightened rules designed to deter companies from pursuing ‘inversion’ deals to move their bases abroad and reduce their tax rates. It is not technically an inversion, since Allergan is nominally doing the buying, but will massively cut Pfizer’s US tax bill – from 25% to 17% by some estimates.\nThere are other benefits to the deal, according to industry observers. Analyst Alastair McCaig at IG in London, UK, says the $6–8 billion of tax savings is not to be sniffed at, but points to other drivers. ‘There is a good fit between the businesses,’ he says.\nThere is not a lot of overlap between the two companies’ drug portfolios, which makes them complementary. Allergan is strong in aesthetics – centred around Botox (onabotulinum toxin A); eye care; anti-infectives; gastrointestinal and neurology – areas Pfizer exited or de-prioritised some years ago.  \nUpsides, but not new drugs\nMerger and acquisition activity by Pfizer was not unexpected. ‘Pfizer needed to replenish its basket of approved drugs. It needed to buy products that were already available on the market, specifically in the US, where the profit premiums are so much greater,’ says McCaig. ‘Part of the reason is that in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies effectively battened down the hatches and cut costs. They were reluctant to spend money, reduced head count and cut back on R&D. And now they find themselves with this shortfall or inability to produce new drugs.’\n‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens’ While Pfizer invests in significant in-house R&D, Allergan has tended to buy potential targets in the drug discovery phase. ‘Unlike the AstraZeneca case, this probably won’t have a significant impact on R&D operations,’ says Aris Angelis from the London School of Economics, UK. ‘There might be some reasonable workforce optimisation, but there is not much therapeutic area complementarity between the two companies and Allergan’s R&D should not suffer much.’\nThat said, mergers are not known for driving new drug discovery. ‘I would not expect a significant increase in innovative output from the combined new company,’ adds Angelis, who criticised  last year’s proposed AstraZeneca–Pfizer deal , and recently  blogged  about the proposed Allergan–Pfizer embrace. \nHe is not alone in his pessimism. ‘The question now is: what will Pfizer–Allergan buy next. Or it could start spinning things off, but where is it going to get new drugs from?’ asks Brozak. ‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens that are basically driving these entities,’ he says. ‘What I care about is the value of the shares tomorrow, and that isn’t driven by tax codes. It is driven by discovery of new healthcare products and technologies.’\nThe hurdles ahead\nThe new company will have better access to cash to invest in R&D and manufacturing, according to Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive . ‘I want to stress that we are not doing this transaction simply as a tax transaction. We are doing this because of the strategic importance of the franchises, the revenue growth we believe we can get within the US and internationally, and the importance to combine the research approaches,’ Read said on Monday in a call with analysts.\nThe move also gives Allergan access to 70 markets it does not operate in today. Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said during the call with analysts that the company has almost zero presence in some of the biggest markets, such as Japan, the second biggest pharmaceutical market in the world. ‘You have a multi-billion dollar business in Pfizer that already exists there. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our product flow into Japan in an efficient way. [That] issue is solved through this transaction,’ he said.\nThe new entity will continue to be called Pfizer, with Pfizer stockholders owning around 56% and Allergan shareholders 44%. The deal must be approved by both sets of shareholders, as well as regulators in the US and the EU.\nThere is concern among investors that the deal could be stymied by the US government. Some analysts say Allergan and Pfizer are understating potential tax and other savings in the face of US political opposition to tax inversions.\nThe union will require 9 months gestation, and analysts say this gives time for the US government to undercut it. Already, the leading US presidential candidates have criticised Pfizer’s actions. But Pfizer has learned from the experience of trying to merge with AstraZeneca last year and has tried to cover all its bases. It neatly sidestepped new rules to impede tax inversions from the US Treasury, which has admitted it can do little more to prevent the deals without legislation from Congress. \nThe life sciences sector has been gripped by a mergers and acquisition frenzy, and it looks set to continue.

We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nClinton went on to say that she would soon be rolling out specific plans to prevent inversions and to close other loopholes in the tax code so firms can’t “game the international tax system.” She added that she wants Congress to act immediately to make sure that large corporations pay their “fair share” and called on regulators to “look hard at stronger actions they can take.”\nThe U.S. has in recent years seen a growth in the number of tax inversions, in which an American company buys a foreign one and officially moves abroad to take advantage of a foreign country’s lower tax rate, even while leaving its headquarters and operations back in the U.S.\nRELATED:  Competitor to offer $1 pill after Turing price hike outrage\nBurger King and Fruit of the Loom are some of the better known brands to legally move abroad, but pharmaceutical firms have been among the most aggressive in exploiting the move.\nSanders said the Pfizer-Allergan deal would be “disaster” and called on the Obama administration to stop the merger, which would create the largest drug-maker in the world. “The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said in a statement.\n“The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority. Congress also must pass real tax reform that demands that profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” he added.\nChallenger Martin O’Malley also announced opposition to the deal and tried to earn points for fighting a similar deal as the governor of Maryland. “Leadership is about actions, not just words, and leading with our principles. I oppose the Pfizer merger now, just as I opposed the last Pfizer merger as Governor of Maryland, because it would have cost Maryland jobs and sent corporate taxes abroad,” he said in a statement.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.” Sen.

In the past, however, they have tended to cite inversions as evidence of the need to reduce the corporate tax rate, not as an example of corporate greed. \n“We can rail all we want about how unpatriotic it is and how angry we are that Pfizer is selling to another company and they’re going to move outside of America,” Florida Sen.

Johnson November 23 Follow @carolynyjohnson\nAllergan's $160 billion purchase of Pfizer gives it a lineup of fast growing drugs and a lower tax rate. The merger will create the world's largest drug maker in a controversial inversion deal. (Reuters)\nPfizer and Allergan on Monday morning announced they would merge in a massive, $160 billion deal that will create the world's largest drugmaker, producing treatments as varied as Lipitor and Botox.\nThe deal is structured as a reverse merger, with smaller Dublin-based Allergan buying New York-based Pfizer, and it is likely to renew concerns over "inversions," where U.S. companies are bought by or merge with foreign firms in order to reduce U.S. corporate tax burdens. In a press release, Pfizer said the combined company would generate more than $2 billion in savings over the first three years and would enjoy a tax rate of 17 to 18 percent -- far less than Pfizer's current corporate tax rate of 25 percent.\nJust days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department issued rules seeking to crack down on these types of deals, which President Obama has labeled " unpatriotic ."\n[ Pfizer-Allergan merger shows why it's so hard to stop tax-dodging companies ]\nLast year, several such inversion deals fell apart and sparked scrutiny of corporate tax loopholes. In October 2014, Chicago-based AbbVie and Dublin-based Shire  called off a $54 billion inversion deal after the Treasury issued new rules . That same month, Raleigh, N.C.-based Salix Pharmaceuticals and the Italian firm, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA terminated a reverse merger , citing changes in the political environment.\nIn a call with analysts, Pfizer chief executive Ian Read said that Pfizer appreciates the attention to inversions from politicians, presidential candidates, and Treasury but decided to proceed.\n"On the political risk, we've assessed this deal looking at the present regulations, the new notices, and all the information we can glean, and we believe this deal is a great deal for shareholders, both of Allergan and Pfizer," Read said.\nAs measured by annual revenue, Pfizer is more than twice the size of Allergan -- Pfizer reported $49.6 billion in revenues in 2014 , while Allergan, which recently merged with Actavis , projected a combined $23 billion in revenues for 2015. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and create a combined company with an operating cash flow of more than $25 billion by 2018. Current Allergan shareholders will own 44 percent of the combined company, while Pfizer shareholders will own 56 percent -- a careful division of ownership that is structured to avoid triggering additional taxes. Federal rules subject inverted companies to more taxes if the shareholders of the U.S. company own at least 60 percent of the shares.\nGustav Ando, research director for IHS Life Sciences, a business information and consulting company, said that he thought the deal was carefully structured and likely to be approved, but added that it may receive even more scrutiny due to the current public and political outrage over high drug prices for the pharmaceutical industry.\n"This merger isn’t meant to benefit patients; it isn’t meant to innovate in any kind of way. It’s basically a tax inversion strategy, and certainly the benefits won’t be passed on to consumers," Ando said. "It's pretty easy at the moment to paint the pharmaceutical industry in a negative light and this certainly doesn’t do anything to help the cause. It definitely increases the reputational risks to the industry."\n[Read more:  Specialty drugs now cost more than the median household income ]\nThe combined company, which will be called Pfizer plc, will bring together a huge U.S. pharmaceutical company best known for iconic drugs like the cholesterol-fighting Lipitor and erectile dysfunction medication Viagra with Allergan, which is best known for making wrinkle-smoothing Botox.\nAllergan is technically buying Pfizer due to the structure of the deal. Before the merger, Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each share they own. Pfizer stockholders will receive one share for each share they own. The new company will be combined under Allergan plc, which will then rename itself Pfizer plc. The company will maintain its global headquarters in New York, but its key executive offices will be in Ireland, the statement said.\nIn a letter to Sen. Mitch McConnell, Pfizer's chief executive, Read, reiterated the combined company's deep commitment to the U.S., noting that when the deal is expected to close there will be 40,000 employees spread across 25 states.\n"We believe this will be good for patients and for U.S. competitiveness," Read wrote to McConnell.\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders both put out statements denouncing the deal.\n"This proposed merger, and so-called ‘inversions’ by other companies, will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag," Clinton said. "As President, I will fight to reform our tax system to reward growth, innovation, and job creation here in the United States. "\nSanders said the merger would be punishing for consumers in America who already pay higher prices for prescription drugs than the rest of the world.\n"The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority," Sanders said.\nWhile the merger will create a behemoth pharmaceutical company, most industry watchers expect the growth to precede a major split in which Pfizer will spin off its business into two separate companies. One company is expected to focus on research and development of new, innovative drugs, and the other will focus on the pipeline of generic products.\n"Probably, the company will now be splitting itself up. That’s the part of the strategy," said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School. "They’re pretty clear about it -- it’s bulking up in order to slim down."\nAndo noted that follows a larger trend in the pharmaceutical industry, in which pharmaceutical companies that have grown or acquired different lines of business spin off companies, too. For example, Baxter International Inc. this year spun off its biopharmaceutical drug business into a separate company, Baxalta.\nDimitri Drone, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that buying and selling has become the "new normal" in the pharmaceutical industry, with companies buying up others and also splitting off specific parts of the business.\n"Joining forces with Pfizer matches our leading products in seven high growth therapeutic areas and our robust R&D pipeline with Pfizer’s leading innovative and established businesses, vast global footprint and strength in discovery and development research to create a new biopharma leader," Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said in a statement.\nMore from Wonkblog:\nCarolyn Johnson is a reporter covering the business of health.

Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan will merge, creating the world's biggest drug-maker by sales. Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP\nThe Pfizer flag flies in front of its world headquarters in New York. Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan will merge, creating the world's biggest drug-maker by sales. Mark Lennihan/AP\nThe U.S. drug giant Pfizer and its smaller rival Allergan have agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by sales.\nThe $160 billion deal is the largest example so far of a corporate inversion, in which a U.S. company merges with a foreign company and shifts its domicile overseas in order to lower its corporate taxes.\nBecause Allergan is based in Dublin, New York-based Pfizer can move its corporate home to Ireland, where the official tax rate is lower. But it will essentially remain the same company, with the same name, CEO and even the same stock ticker symbol.\nThe deal, which was approved unanimously by the boards of the two companies on Sunday, brings together the makers of Viagra and Botox, creating a drug industry powerhouse, The Wall Street Journal reports . The newspaper adds:\n"The merger will create a pharmaceutical behemoth, with top-selling products including Pfizer's Prevnar pneumonia vaccine and Allergan's anti-wrinkle treatment Botox and industry-topping R&D budget. The company's drugs and vaccines would cover a range of diseases, from Alzheimer's to cancer, eye health to rheumatoid arthritis."\nIn a statement , Pfizer CEO Ian Read said the deal "will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world":\n"Allergan's businesses align with and enhance Pfizer's businesses, creating best-in-class, sustainable, innovative and established businesses that are poised for growth.\n"Through this combination, Pfizer will have greater financial flexibility that will facilitate our continued discovery and development of new innovative medicines for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continued investment in the United States, while also enabling our pursuit of business development opportunities on a more competitive footing within our industry."\nThe merger is likely to be controversial and increase pressure on Congress to take on the inversion trend.\nThe Treasury Department proposed new rules to make inversions somewhat tougher to pull off several days ago, but the Obama administration says congressional action is needed to really address the issue.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:37.695134-06

Photograph: Image Broker/Rex\nPfizer and Allergan are considering a merger that would unite the US makers of Viagra and Botox to create a drugs giant worth more than $300bn.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer had approached Allergan, but cautioned that the process was at an early stage and might not lead to a deal.\nThe mega-merger would be by far the biggest in a flurry of deals in the industry this year. Allergan has a market value of $113bn (£81bn); Pfizer is worth $219bn. Together they would overtake Johnson & Johnson, worth $278bn, as the world’s largest healthcare company.\nPfizer is attracted to Allergan because it is domiciled in Ireland and its tax rate is far below Pfizer’s in the US. The New York-based drug maker had a stab at shifting its tax base last year, but failed in its £70bn takeover attempt of British firm AstraZeneca .\nLast autumn, a US crackdown on tax avoidance deals scuppered AbbVie’s agreed takeover of Shire , which is based in Dublin, like Allergan. It is unclear whether the rule changes would affect the potential tax advantages from a Pfizer-Allergan deal.\nPfizer also wants to beef up its branded-drug portfolio after boosting its off-patent business with the $16bn acquisition of Hospira at the start of the year . Pfizer boss Ian Read has made no secret of his desire to split the two businesses at some point.\nStephen Brozak, analyst at WBB Securities, said: “When you’re the size of Pfizer, an acquisition like this may be the only choice you have in order to be able to move the needle for sequential growth ... so the question now becomes, if not this, what? And if not now, when?”\nPfizer produces Viagra and the cholesterol pill Lipitor, once the world’s bestselling drug; Allergan is best known for Botox and also makes the dry-eye treatment Restasis.\nShares in Allergan jumped nearly 9% to $312.45 in on the reports. In London, GlaxoSmithKline and Shire shares were down 1.5% and 2.4% respectively, as Pfizer had been mooted as a potential buyer for the companies. AstraZeneca was down by 0.8%.\nPfizer previously failed in its attempt to buy Actavis, which went on to acquire Allergan and adopted the company’s name. Allergan sold its generic business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical for $40.5bn in July.\nAnalysts said one of the main hurdles in the way of a Pfizer-Allergan deal was price. Jonathan Morgan, head of research at The Edge Consulting Group, said: “Looking at valuations, Allergan trades at a higher multiple versus GSK – or for that matter AstraZeneca – and we believe the pricing of the deal may be something of an obstacle.\n“If the deal does go through a further restructuring at Pfizer would be a possibility, as the company at some point would like to separate its patent-protected drugs portfolio from its off-patented drugs.”\nThis discussion is closed for comments.\nWe’re doing some maintenance right now.

Instead, the huge price spikes are usually by smaller companies that own drugs for rare diseases.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan merger, worth approximately $160 billion, would be the second-largest of all time, according to Dealogic, behind only the 1999 merger of two telecommunications firms.\nThe companies said they expected the deal to close by the end 2016.\nAllergan ( AGN ) , based in Dublin, is best known as the maker of Botox.\nThe combined company would top industry leaders Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Novartis ( NVS ) in terms of sales and market value.\nThe mega deal is also the latest example of the massive wave of consolidation in health care. Drug makers, insurers, hospitals and pharmacies have raced to bulk up in recent years as the business landscape has been altered by Obamacare and an aging population.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan announcement is expected to be controversial in political circles.\nThe deal would move New York-based Pfizer ( PFE ) to Ireland -- making it the latest merger that will let a U.S. company slash its federal corporate tax bill.\nPfizer has been openly critical of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Last year, when it tried unsuccessfully to acquire British drug maker AstraZeneca, Pfizer didn't hide the fact that tax savings were one of the main drivers.\nMergers like Pfizer-Allergan are known as tax inversions. In such deals, bigger American companies buy smaller foreign ones and then switch their headquarters (at least on paper) to the location of the smaller company.\nBurger King made headlines last year when it bought Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons and moved its address to Canada.\nInversions are legal but have been criticized, particularly by Democrats, as a way for companies to beat Uncle Sam.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department unveiled new rules Thursday to make it harder for companies to do inversions. But without Congressional action, the Treasury rules were not expected alone to stop a Pfizer-Allergan tie up.\n--CNNMoney's Paul R.

GSK operates a large manufacturing facility that recently went through major upgrades in Zebulon , which would very likely stay in operation. However, the company already significantly reduced its research and development operations in Research Triangle Park , and more jobs there could be at risk in a combined R&D department.\nPfizer employs 630 workers in North Carolina, including 400 at a site in Sanford. It also recently acquired Hospira , which operates a manufacturing facility in Rocky Mount, though is shuttering a manufacturing plant in Clayton .\nA combined Pfizer, based in New York City, and GSK, based in London, would be a staggering company indeed. Pfizer, the maker of drugs like Viagra and Celebrex, reports $50 billion in total sales and $12 billion in operating profit. GSK, maker of Advair and Flovent, had nearly $40 billion in sales and $6 billion in operating profit. If the companies were combined at their current stock prices, they would hold a market value of $320 billion. For comparison, Google has a market cap of $368 billion.\nDespite it’s size, GSK has hit some choppy waters in the past few years. Since CEO Andrew Witty took over in 2008, annual revenue has dropped 6 percent and GSK shares have underperformed the pharmaceutical market as a whole by 80 percent, according to an analysis by Financial Times. The company still has a strong portfolio of products, however, including a next-generation line of respiratory products that Witty hopes will make up for lagging Advair sales. GSK is also doubling down on HIV/AIDS research .\nTo be sure, rumors are what they are, and Bloomberg reports that a Citigroup Inc. analyst in London has doubts about an acquisition. Still, the sale of Salix to Valeant and a large round of layoffs at GSK started as rumors, as well, and more than a few analysts of the pharmaceutical industry have noted that acquisitions have grown larger and larger.\nWhat will officially play out remains to be seen, and these rumors will likely several more turns. But, at least “PfizerKline” rolls off the tongue nicely. Jason deBruyn covers the biopharmaceutical and health care industries.

( PFE ) for struggling GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) is heating up, after one closely-watched biotech analyst said in a note this week that Pfizer buying the company would “unlock access to its balance sheet and improve its tax situation.” Gregg Gilbert , a biotech analyst at Deutsche Bank , wrote in a note to investors “Introducing PfizerKline ” that he thinks a deal would be “materially accretive” for both companies. “We believe that the company has a sense of urgency to create value by leveraging the power of its balance sheet to do needle-moving deals,” Gilbert wrote. “Since media reports in the past have pointed to the potential for a Pfizer/GSK combination, we are revisiting that theme.” Gilbert estimated that a bid priced at $29.86 a share, via half stock and half cash, which would push up Pfizer ’s earnings per share by 10 percent to 16 percent beginning in 2016. Two weeks ago we asked our readers, with cash to burn, will Pfizer go hunting for Glaxo ? The BioSpace ( DHX ) community certainly believes that deal-hungry Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will make a bid for competitor GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) , and that bid will come in the third quarter of this year and be priced in the not insignificant $120 billion or more range. Almost a year after its $119 billion offer for AstraZeneca PLC ( AZN ) fell apart in the face of massive opposition from regulators and internal dissent, global drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is once again being floated as a potential buyer of another marquee-name British pharmaceutical company: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) . Now, we know what you think: That 63 percent of 500 respondents do think Pfizer will make some sort of bid for Glaxo , though 37 percent of those were not as sure. In addition, 48 percent of those polled said they believed Pfizer would tender its offer during the third quarter of 2015, 39 percent said the fourth quarter, and 13 percent said the second quarter. The most astonishing metrics were in the potential bid price, however: 35 percent of respondents thought Pfizer would offer more than $120 billion for Glaxo , while 26 percent said the price tag would be over $150 billion, 25 percent thought more than $110 billion, and 14 percent said the bid wouldn’t be more than $110 billion. The argument for a Pfizer/Glaxo marriage had Wall Street ruminating last month. A column in The Telegraph today said that while some market watchers might consider such an audacious bid “bonkers,” there are plenty of reasons deal-hungry Pfizer might want to merge with Glaxo . First, Pfizer is still desperate to do a big deal. The company has tens of billions of pounds sitting dormant in overseas subsidiaries, cash that it cannot repatriate to America without being hit by a colossal tax bill,” wrote columnist Ben Markow .\n   Related Jobs      Sr. Scientist - Amgen    Chief of Staff - Pfizer    Clinical Trial Heads - Novartis Oncology    Sr. Research Associate - Genentech    Scientist I/II - MedImmune    Clinical Trials Manager - Jazz Pharma    View More Jobs “In addition, it needs access to a bigger pipeline of new medicines. Patents on many of its top-selling drugs are expiring, including Viagra — leaving the products open to competition from generic rivals.” Markow said that secondly, that Glaxo , despite its market cap, “looks vulnerable to a bid.” “Although, at £75 billion, it is safely out of the reach of most in the pharma industry, it is less than half the size of Pfizer , Roche ( RHHBY ) and Novartis AG ( NVS ). Although a stretch, such beasts could still conceivably swallow Glaxo ,” he wrote. “One consequence of Pfizer ’s bid for Astra , and a string of other bumper takeovers both before and since, is that suddenly almost any deal looks plausible.” Recent history bolsters Markow’s theory. Pressure from internal decision makers at Pfizer Inc. (PFE) pushed Chief Executive Officer Ian Read to approach Israeli drug company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ( TEVA ) at the end of 2014 about a possible merger, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News at the end of January, but that bid was immediately rejected. Neither Teva or Pfizer would comment on the story, but Read has said in the past that he is dedicated to building out the company’s businesses via “bolt-on” acquisitions or even wholesale takeovers. “Certainly I feel a sense of urgency on utilizing our balance sheet and our capital to do deals that are incremental, add incremental value and certainly add revenue growth in the innovative space,” said Read on a conference call with analysts in October. “We are aggressively looking at all alternatives.” That aggressive pursuit led Pfizer to take an unsuccessful run at acquiring British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) for $119 billion—but that bid, too, fell apart, leaving Pfizer with a stack of cash and frustrated aspirations. The majority of the respondents in this week’s poll were from the United States , with 78 percent of the 500 participants based in America. The rest hailed from a host of countries including Belgium , Germany , France , Canada , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , Australia , Puerto Rico , Montenegro , Brazil , Egypt , Colombia , Romania , Lithuania , Japan , Ireland , Israel , Greece , India , Thailand , Switzerland , the Netherlands and Singapore . Three percent of respondents declined to identify their country of domicile. For states, California led the pack, with 17 percent of the poll’s respondents based in that state. Pennsylvania followed with 12 percent , then New Jersey at 10 percent . The rest were distributed throughout the U.S. Will Mylan Buy Teva, As Predator Becomes Prey? The complicated three-way takeover waltz being conducted between Pittsburgh, Penn.-based Mylan Inc. , Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ( TEVA ) and Perrigo Company ( PRGO ) took another weird turn last week, after Mylan said that while it still views Teva’s unsolicited $40.1 billion bid as too low, it might want to acquire Teva itself eventually. Mylan Chairman Robert J. Coury made it clear that if Mylan is able to cement its deal with Perrigo, it might go shopping again—and this time to buy Teva, not be bought. With dealmaking heating up in 2015, we wanted to know your thoughts: Will perennial predator Teva wind up being prey?	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:04:37.701732-06

Read, told them that a merger with Allergan, the maker of Botox that is based in Dublin, would significantly cut Pfizer’s tax bill and give it more cash that it could invest in the United States and ultimately add jobs, according to people briefed on the calls. He made the calls in recent days as the two companies were hammering out a $152 billion deal .\nMonday’s announcement of the deal — the biggest merger in 15 years — has revived a fierce public debate over whether mergers that allow a company in the United States to relocate to a lower-tax country are, in fact, good for America.\nPfizer, founded by German immigrants in Brooklyn in 1849, is becoming the biggest company yet to shed its American citizenship to lower its taxes. While not structured as what is known as an inversion, it achieves the same goal of a lower tax rate abroad. Continue reading the main story\nRecord Year of Deal-Making\nGiant impending deals announced this year include:\nAn aborted bid by Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca of Britain in an inversion last year set off a public uproar — leading President Obama to call such deals “unpatriotic” — and prompted moves by the Treasury to curb them.\nThe latest merger announcement has stirred a similar outcry across the political spectrum.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nDonald J. Trump, a Republican candidate for president, said in a statement: “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting. Our politicians should be ashamed.”\nYet the two companies and their advisers are betting that the Treasury Department will not be able to come up with new rules to block the union, and that Congress will fail to revamp the tax code before the merger’s expected close late next year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnd as Mr. Read has made clear publicly and privately, his main priority is doing well by his shareholders — and that means finding a way to compete with huge foreign rivals that enjoy much lower tax rates.\n“We’ve assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of the patients and to bring value to shareholders,” Mr. Read said on Monday on a call with analysts. “That is our obligation.”\nMr. Read and those close to him have noted that Pfizer, based in New York, has been upfront about its intentions. Even after its takeover campaign for AstraZeneca collapsed, the Pfizer chief made no secret of his desire to try again, while criticizing a tax code that he said leaves his company fighting with one hand tied behind its back.\nThe drug maker, which manufactured penicillin during World War II, has complained that its tax rate last year was 26 percent, compared with the approximately 5 percent that Allergan’s predecessor company paid during that same time.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBigger international rivals, from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of Britain to Novartis of Switzerland, also pay substantially less in taxes, potentially letting them win takeover contests with higher bids.\nPerhaps more important, Pfizer kept overseas $74 billion in profits that were earned abroad last year, because bringing them home would have racked up billions of dollars in taxes.\nSince the AstraZeneca bid, the Obama administration has introduced new rules that have made it harder for companies to do inversion deals, scuttling efforts by companies like AbbVie , a large drug maker based in Illinois, to relocate abroad.\nFrom the beginning of their deal discussions nearly three months ago, Pfizer and Allergan agreed that the best way forward was to forgo an inversion altogether, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Instead, Allergan would serve as the buyer despite being substantially smaller.\nMindful of the sensitivity in Washington, Pfizer included in its advisory team the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company, whose vice chairman is Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader.\nWhile Mr. Cantor will not lobby lawmakers, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, he has advised the company on political aspects of the deal and maintains friendly contact with his former colleagues.\nDespite the political uproar, the merger is not expected to encounter significant resistance from the American regulator that will review the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the people with direct knowledge of the deal.\nA spokesman for the Treasury Department said on Monday that it did not comment on specific transactions. Still, the department has clearly signaled its distaste for deals that move a company’s tax home.\nThe particular design of Monday’s transaction, however, effectively shields Pfizer and Allergan from the administration’s efforts to curb such deals. Continue reading the main story\nRelated Tax Inversion Coverage\nWhen the Treasury Department announced its latest rule changes on Thursday, advisers to both companies sat down to review the changes — and quickly went back to work on their negotiations, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n“Treasury’s proposals don’t touch them,” said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant who examined the deal.\nPresidential candidates offered swift condemnation of the transaction all the same.\nSuch transactions, Mrs. Clinton said, “take advantage of loopholes that litter our tax code, distort incentives for investment and disadvantage small businesses and domestic firms that cannot game the international tax system.”\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, said, “The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority.”\nYet others said a broader tax overhaul was needed.\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the news of the merger “only further underscores the arcane, anticompetitive nature of the U.S. tax code.”\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nExecutives at both Pfizer and Allergan are betting that Congress will continue to be conflicted about how to deal with inversions. Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have called for a comprehensive regulatory overhaul and have shown reluctance to focus on particular companies.\n“It’s not clear what Washington’s wishes are,” said one person close to the transaction. “We tried to tell them to fix our tax system. It’s not like this is a surprise.”\nAt the same time, both Mr. Read and his counterpart at Allergan, Brenton L. Saunders, have emphasized that the deal isn’t being done just to cut taxes.\nBoth executives contend the deal gives Pfizer access to fast-growing treatments in the eye care and dermatology space, as well as brands like Botox and the cosmetic treatment Juvéderm.\nMoreover, it will give Pfizer enough size and product diversity to break itself up in three years’ time, dividing itself into a company focused on faster-growing innovative drugs and another built on more mature treatments that face competition from generic competitors. The company said on Monday that it would decide in late 2018 whether to proceed with a split.\nBuying Allergan will bring more fast-growing treatments to Pfizer’s portfolio. That would complement Pfizer’s $17 billion acquisition of the generic drug maker Hospira earlier this year, meant to bulk up its so-called established treatments division.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Pfizer would essentially pay $363.63 for each Allergan share, representing a nearly 30 percent premium to Allergan’s share price in late October before news emerged that they were in talks. That values the acquisition at $152 billion. Including debt and subtracting cash, the deal is worth $160 billion.\nAfter the transaction, Pfizer shareholders are expected to own about 56 percent of the combined company, with the remaining 44 percent owned by Allergan shareholders. Mr. Read will be chief executive of the new Pfizer P.L.C., to be based in Dublin, while Mr. Saunders will become president, and will be in line to take over one of the company’s businesses if and when it decides to break itself up.\nInvestors appeared unimpressed. Shares of Allergan fell 3.4 percent, while Pfizer’s ended down 2.6 percent.\nThe expected cost savings of about $2 billion over the first three years announced after the deal was made were well below most analysts’ projections. And the $5 billion in planned stock buybacks that also were announced on Monday were in line with Pfizer’s previous efforts.\nSome analysts still regarded the deal positively, so far as it ties into Pfizer’s goals.\n“Allergan was easier to get done as a friendly deal in terms of getting a structure done and management roles done,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst with Jefferies.\nTo some involved in the deal, the tax savings are all that matters. “If the tax stuff went away entirely, the deal would be off,” a person briefed on Mr. Read’s thinking said.\nLiz Moyer, Chad Bray and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.\nA version of this article appears in print on November 24, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Chief of Pfizer Defends Merger as Good for U.S. Order Reprints | Today's Paper | Subscribe	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.133865-06

The guidance will reflect the anticipated contribution from Hospira operations \nfrom the time of the completion of the Hospira merger to Pfizer's ...	5	\N	Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Hospira\nCreates a leading Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) Business Expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted diluted EPS  upon closing; $0.10-$0.12 accretion to adjusted diluted EPS expected in first full year after close with additional accretion anticipated thereafter\nThursday, September 3, 2015 - 9:00am\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Hospira, Inc.\n“We are pleased that Hospira, the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, is now part of Pfizer. We want to welcome our new Hospira colleagues to Pfizer. We are excited to add their talents and proud of the shared commitment of all Pfizer colleagues to serving patients worldwide,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. “We believe that through this transaction, we’ve created value for our shareholders by delivering incremental revenue and expected EPS growth in the near-term by strengthening our GEP business and positioning it for future growth.”\nPfizer’s GEP business now has a leadership position in the large and growing sterile injectables category, with a robust portfolio of both generic and branded products. The global market for generic sterile injectables is estimated to be $70 billion in 2020. In addition, GEP has significantly advanced its biosimilars business with a broadened portfolio of marketed products and pipeline assets, which will benefit from Pfizer’s best-in-class capabilities in monoclonal antibody development and manufacturing. The global market for biosimilars is estimated to be approximately $20 billion in 2020. The industry-leading medication management systems business, which is now part of GEP, is a complementary business that benefits patients and healthcare systems through improved accuracy and productivity in clinical care. Pfizer is now poised to use its commercial capabilities, global scale, scientific expertise and manufacturing prowess, which now includes two of the largest sterile injectable manufacturing facilities in the world, to maximize the global potential of its enhanced GEP portfolio of sterile injectables, biosimilars and medication management systems.\n“Pfizer and Hospira are now one unified team providing patients with access to one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios of difficult-to-manufacture, life-saving sterile injectable products in the industry. Together, we are also a leading global biosimilars company with a robust pipeline, best-in-class development capabilities and extensive real-world commercialization experience. We can also deliver novel capabilities through our medication management systems business,” said John Young, group president, Global Established Pharmaceutical business. “By increasing the number and availability of high-quality generic injectable drugs and biosimilars that we offer our customers, we are strengthening our commitment to improving the health and quality of life of patients around the world with high quality medicines across key therapeutic areas.”\nPfizer continues to expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to adjusted diluted EPS 1  upon closing, and accretive by $0.10 - $0.12 per share in the first full year after the close, with additional accretion anticipated thereafter. In addition, Pfizer expects the transaction will deliver $800 million in annual cost synergies by 2018. Pfizer intends to update its 2015 financial guidance in the coming weeks to incorporate Hospira. The guidance will reflect the anticipated contribution from Hospira operations from the time of the completion of the Hospira merger to Pfizer's fiscal year end, which is November 30, 2015 for Pfizer’s international fiscal year and December 31, 2015 for Pfizer’s U.S. fiscal year.\nHospira, Inc. is now a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps.\nInformation for Hospira Shareholders\nOn September 3, 2015, Hospira’s common stock ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and former Hospira shareholders became entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $90 in cash (without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes) for each share of Hospira common stock they owned as of September 3, 2015.\nFor Hospira registered shareholders, Pfizer has appointed Computershare Trust Company N.A. as paying agent for payment of the merger consideration. Information concerning the exchange of Hospira shares for the per share merger consideration is being mailed to Hospira registered shareholders, outlining the steps to be taken to obtain the merger consideration.

(Spencer Platt)\nMichael Hiltzik Contact Reporter The Economy Hub\nA corporate tax dodge known as "inversions" had a moment in the spotlight about a year ago, when a number of such high-profile mergers got U.S. Treasury officials, politicians and voters steaming. \nInversions are mergers in which a big U.S. company buys a smaller foreign company and reincorporates in the foreign land to take advantage of its lower corporate tax rate. Following the public uproar and a tightening of Treasury rules--and a public denunciation  from President Obama --inversions ebbed, for a bit. (We reported on the inversion craze here ,  here  and here .)\nThe shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return. - Pfizer Chairman Ian Read\nBut a huge merger being discussed by Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan has revived the specter of these tax-advantaged flights of corporate assets from U.S. shores. The deal, which the companies say is under "preliminary" discussion, would create the world's largest drugmaker, valued at more than $300 billion.\nIt also would lower Pfizer's effective U.S. tax rate--though by how much isn't clear, since many critics think the company's declared effective rate of 25.5% in 2014 is vastly overstated. The key may be that the deal would relieve Pfizer of the potential tax burden of as much as $148 billion  in overseas earnings it has stashed overseas. That money would be subject to U.S. taxes if brought home, but might be permanently sheltered under the terms of an inversion merger.\nThe Inversion Craze\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004.\nTax-advantaged inversion deals surged after since 2004. (Congressional Research Service)\nPfizer has been among the nation's most aggressive exploiters of U.S. tax breaks by booking business expenses in the U.S. and shifting income abroad, according to critics such as Americans for Tax Fairness. In a report  issued this month, the organization asserted that Pfizer's effective tax rate last year actually was only 7.5%, not 25.5%. The discrepancy was due to "accounting fiction," including the reporting of "deferred taxes" that the company is unlikely to pay in the future. \nPfizer maintains that its income policies and tax reporting comply with all government rules and regulations. No one has shown they don't.\nWhat's unclear is why Pfizer would aggressively overstate its tax bite, since that means understating its earnings. Among the possibilities, experts say, is that the company fears that revealing its inordinately low real tax rate might attract unwelcome attention from pharmaceutical and tax regulators. Or it might be building up a reserve of deferred taxes to apply to any overseas earnings it eventually repatriates to the U.S., whether under orders from U.S. tax authorities or voluntarily, as part of a partial amnesty.\nClose loopholes that let U.S. firms avoid taxes by using inversions Michael Hiltzik It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... It's both endearing and infuriating to watch American corporate executives wring their hands about how the injustices of the U.S. tax code are forcing them — forcing them! — to reincorporate overseas through the procedure known as inversion. Endearing, because one wants to sympathize with the pain... (Michael Hiltzik)\nInversions aren't illegal, though they have been politically touchy. Pfizer Chairman Ian Read acknowledged as much during a conference call with securities analysts  Oct. 27, but said the "political ramifications" wouldn't stop him from taking any step he judged to be in his shareholders' and employees' interests. "The shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return," he said, "and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust, successful company."\nThe political issues can't be dismissed so lightly, however. Obama took aim  last year at companies he called "corporate deserters--a small but growing group of big corporations that are fleeing the country to get out of paying taxes.... They’re declaring they’re based someplace else even though most of their operations are here."  \nA tightening of regulations by the Treasury Department last year succeeded in quashing several large inversion deals. Among other things, tax officials are certain to be on the lookout for any merger-related maneuvers that seem aimed at reducing the percentage of Pfizer shareholders still holding interests in the merged companies. That's a key metric followed by the Treasury. These steps could include spinoffs of existing businesses or stock buybacks that pay off shareholders with cash.\nA Pfizer deal might also spur Congress and the White House to finally make a permanent deal on corporate taxes--which could be good or bad for companies like Pfizer, depending on the terms. \nThat effort should start with a two-year moratorium on all inversions "to reduce the hemorrhaging," suggests Edward D. Kleinbard , a USC law professor whose role as a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation certifies him as one of our leading experts on the corporate tax.\nKleinbard argues that the elements of a new corporate tax structure have long been clear on both sides of the partisan aisle. "The scope of disagreement between [House Speaker Paul] Ryan and President Obama is so small that they could work out the bullet points in the course of a weekend," he says. \nThe points would include reducing the corporate tax rate, which tops out at 35%, to somewhere around 25% while eliminating a host of corporate tax rates and taxing earnings on a territorial basis--that is, levying U.S. tax chiefly on income earned within the U.S., perhaps with a lower but minimum tax on foreign earnings. That would encourage companies to bring foreign earnings back to the U.S., where they could be invested in the U.S. economy.\nSuch changes might not quell the incessant whining by American companies about our high corporate tax rate--although, as Pfizer shows, they rarely pay anything approaching the statutory rate. But in practical terms it might quell their appetite for merger deals that make sense largely as tax maneuvers. American business ingenuity is almost limitless, and it might do everyone good for it to be applied to developing useful new drugs and other products, instead of tax schemes.\nKeep up to date with the Economy Hub.

With a research and development budget of $7.1 billion in 2003, the new Pfizer is now the world's leading research-based pharmaceutical company.\n"Today we go forward as a single company, providing more products to help more patients than any other pharmaceutical company has ever done before," said Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hank McKinnell. "On any given day, we estimate that nearly 40 million people around the world are treated with a Pfizer medicine. Our new company is the global leader in discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines and health care solutions essential to improving global public health and addressing unmet medical needs."\nPharmacia Corporation: A History\nThe roots of Pharmacia Corporation date back over 150 years to 1837 when a leading Italian pharmacist, Carlo Erba, started his own company, which later became Farmitalia Carlo Erba. This company would later unite with Kabi Pharmacia, which began in 1951. These two companies, along with Pharmacia Aktiebolaget, formed the three main points of origin for Pharmacia AB, which was established in Sweden in 1911.\nIn the United States, Pharmacia traces its roots back to 1886. It was then that W.E. Upjohn, M.D., established The Upjohn Pill and Granule Company of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (USA). The company continued its growth throughout the 19th century, eventually evolving into an innovative, international company. Two years later, the Searle and Hereth Co. was formed by a young druggist named Gideon Daniel Searle, as an innovative company developing many "firsts." These firsts include the first bulk laxative, the first motion sickness drug, the first oral contraceptive, the first once-a-day calcium channel blocker for the treatment of hypertension, and many other innovative products. Likewise, Searle discovered and introduced aspartame, a hugely successful sugar substitute. The Searle and Hereth Co. was incorporated in 1908 as G.D. Searle and Co. in Chicago, and in 1985, became the pharmaceutical unit of Monsanto.\nIn 1995, Pharmacia & Upjohn was formed through the merger of Pharmacia AB and The Upjohn Company. Pharmacia & Upjohn became a global provider of human health care products, animal health products, diagnostics and specialty products. In 1998, Pharmacia & Upjohn relocated its global headquarters from the United Kingdom to the United States.\nIn April 2000, Pharmacia & Upjohn completed a merger with Monsanto and Searle creating Pharmacia, a dynamic new competitor in the pharmaceutical industry. This top-tier company's innovative medicines and other products saved the lives of many and enhanced health and wellness. Following the merger, Pharmacia continued Searle's agreement with Pfizer to co-promote Celebrex, which was originally co-developed by Searle and Pfizer.\nIn August 2002, Pharmacia completed the spin-off of its agricultural subsidiary, Monsanto Company.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:03.808533-06
69	3	The Pfizer–Allergan Merger Is a Disgrace - The New Yorker	http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-is-a-disgrace	Nov 23, 2015 ... John Cassidy writes about the proposed merger between pharmaceutical giant \nPfizer and an Ireland-based competitor, Allergan.	9	\N	Ian Read, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, says merging with Allergan would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.” Credit Photograph by Ben Cawthra / Rex Features via AP\nIn an announcement on Monday morning,  Pfizer , the big drug company, whose headquarters are on East 42nd Street, in Manhattan, said that it is merging with one of its competitors, Allergan PLC. Ian Read, a Scottish-born accountant who is Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, said that the proposed deal, which is valued at a hundred and sixty billion dollars, would “create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”\nOn Wall Street and in the world of big pharma, that statement will raise chuckles. It is widely acknowledged that the primary impetus for the deal is a financial one. In merging with Allergan , which is based in Dublin, Pfizer intends to move its corporate residency to Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 per cent, compared to thirty-five per cent for a company of its size in the United States. Over the next few years, the merger could save Pfizer billions of dollars in taxes and deprive the U.S. Treasury of the same amount.\nTax-driven deals of this nature are known as “ inversions ,” and they are becoming increasingly common. Burger King, Liberty Global, and Medtronic are among the U.S. corporations to have carried out mergers that moved their headquarters abroad. Last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew  said that inversions were “wrong,”  and that he would try and restrict them. Only last week, the Treasury Department  issued some new administrative guidelines in this area. Without actual legislation, though, there isn’t very much the Obama Administration can do to prevent these exercises in corporate tax-dodging, and Republicans on Capitol Hill have displayed little eagerness to coöperate in a crackdown.\nThe Pfizer–Allergan deal will be the biggest inversion yet, and it is nothing short of a disgrace. Drug companies like Pfizer have long benefitted from taxpayer-funded research carried out under the auspices of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Now, Pfizer is seeking to avoid paying the taxes that are due on its profits, particularly profits generated by its overseas subsidiaries. Even though the Obama Administration doesn’t have the legal powers to block the Allergan transaction, it should seek to shame Pfizer and its board of directors into calling it off.\nFounded in 1849, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by two German cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Pfizer has a long history of researching and developing new drugs and chemicals. Its first commercial product was an anti-parasitic pill designed to fight intestinal worms, which were a common affliction at the time. In the late nineteenth century, it became a leading manufacturer of citric acid, ascorbic acid, and vitamin pills. During the Second World War, it developed a new way of making penicillin, which was then seen as a miracle drug. After the war, the company established itself as a global leader in antibiotics and other areas of medicine. During the nineteen-seventies and eighties, it invested heavily in R. & D., boosting its research budget to about twenty per cent of its sales. These investments produced a number of blockbuster drugs, including Procardia (angina and hypertension), Glucotrol (diabetes), Feldene (inflammation), Zoloft (depression), and Viagra (erectile dysfunction). In 1999, when Pfizer celebrated its hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it was widely seen as the leading drug company in the world.\nPfizer continues to employ thousands of dedicated scientists and to invest heavily in medical research. Since 2010, though, when Read took over as chief executive, it has cut its R. & D. budget significantly and raised its spending on stock buybacks. Under Read’s leadership,  cost-cutting  and financial engineering have sometimes seemed to be driving the company’s strategy. To some extent, these kinds of changes were unavoidable. As the pace of discovery for blockbuster new drugs has slowed in recent decades, all of the big pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to trim their research budgets and pursue more effective ways of developing products, such as teaming up with innovative startups.\nSo, like many other big American corporations, Pfizer is facing challenges adapting to a changed world. But nothing in its financials or its strategic position suggests that it is facing the sort of threat that might justify the radical and potentially self-destructive move that giving up its U.S. domicile entails. A venerable member of the Fortune 500 now looks for all the world like a greedy tax exile, skipping off to a dodgy foreign locale. (Viewed in terms of its corporate tax policies and the assist it provides to big multinationals seeking to avoid paying taxes in their homelands, Ireland is  distinctly dodgy .)\nRead, in his statement explaining the proposal to merge with Allergan, said that it would help put Pfizer “on a more competitive footing within our industry.” This was a reference to the fact that other big pharma companies, such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis, are headquartered in countries with lower corporate tax rates than the United States. However, there is scant evidence that being based in the United States has handicapped Pfizer or made it more difficult for the company to raise capital.\nTo the contrary, being based in the United States enables Pfizer to exploit the vast reservoirs of technical expertise that reside here, and to access federal support for scientific research. For example, according to the company’s Web site, it has dozens of collaborative projects with the National Institutes for Health. And being headquartered in the United States certainly hasn’t prevented Pfizer from making a lot of money. Over the past two years, the company has generated almost nineteen billion dollars in net profits.\nAll things considered, it’s hard to avoid seeing the merger proposal as a cynical move designed to boost Pfizer’s stock price and generate a windfall for the company’s senior managers, who are compensated mainly in equity. If the Obama Administration can’t block the deal, the best hope may be to put some public pressure on Pfizer’s non-executive directors, whose approval is necessary for the merger to go through. Its lead independent director is Dennis Ausiello, an eminent physician who, for many years, was chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other non-executives  on the Pfizer board  include Frances Fergusson, a former president of Vassar College; Helen Hobbs, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; W. Don Cornwell, a former chief executive of Granite Broadcasting; and James Kilts, a founding partner at the private equity firm Centerview Capital. These directors are all experienced, worldly individuals. Last year, according to Pfizer’s 2015 proxy statement , they were each paid more than three hundred thousand dollars to carry out their duties, which include overseeing the company’s full-time management and protecting the long-term interests of all of its stakeholders: employees, shareholders, and customers.\nOne of those key interests, surely, is safeguarding Pfizer’s reputation, which has already suffered in recent years, following a big  marketing scandal  over the since-discontinued painkiller Bextra and other missteps. Read has for years been telling shareholders in his annual letter to them that “earning greater respect from society” is one of Pfizer’s strategic imperatives. One of the ways the company could do this, he said, was through “acting as a respectable corporate citizen.” So here is a question for the independent directors: Do you really think that traducing Pfizer’s proud history by moving to Dublin and shafting American taxpayers would be the act of a “respectable corporate citizen”?\nSign up for the daily newsletter.

63	3	Pfizer, Allergan considering a merger: DJ, citing sources	http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/pfizer-allegan-considering-a-merger-dj-citing-sources.html	Oct 29, 2015 ... Pfizer has held early talks with Allergan to discuss what could be the biggest \ntakeover deal this year, according to media reports.	3	\N	Pfizer said to be in talks with Allergan to forge $330 bln drugs giant Thursday, 29 Oct 2015 | 7:07 AM ET Reuters\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer has held early talks with Botox-maker Allergan to discuss what could be the biggest takeover deal this year, The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported.\nThe healthcare sector has seen an unprecedented wave of deals since early 2014, from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals, to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers.\nA bid for Allergan, which has a market value of $113 billion, would be Pfizer's second recent attempt to acquire a big rival, following its unsuccessful courtship last year of Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca .\nCombining Allergan and Pfizer, which is worth $219 billion, would create the world's largest healthcare group with a market value of around $330 billion, ahead of Johnson & Johnson on $278 billion.\nA Pfizer spokesman said it "does not comment on market rumor and speculation." Allergan also declined to comment.\nThe potential for lowering Pfizer's tax bill by switching its headquarters from the United States to the United Kingdom was touted by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read as a key reason for the proposed AstraZeneca deal.\nA takeover of Allergan could offer similar advantages given that the Botox-maker is based in lower-tax Dublin. A U.S. attempt to crack down on such tax avoidance deals led to the collapse of AbbVie's bid to buy Shire , but it is unclear whether those rule changes would preclude potential tax advantages from a Pfizer-Allergan deal.\n"When you're the size of Pfizer, an acquisition like this may be the only choice you have in order to be able to move the needle for sequential growth...so the question now becomes, if not this, what, and if not now, when?" said WBB Securities' analyst Stephen Brozak.\nPfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, has also been suggested as a possible acquirer of GlaxoSmithKline and Shire, and shares in these two companies fell 1.5 and 1.8 percent on Thursday morning in London.\nRevenue boost\nMarket top? 2015 set to pass 2000 for M&A record\nBernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Allergan was a good fit and Pfizer might feel now was the right time to do a deal, given a recent market correction that has made Allergan look cheap.\nThe merger talks are in early stages, and may not yield an agreement, while other details are unclear, The Wall Street Journal said.\nThe Financial Times , which reported the talks later, described the talks as preliminary. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the reports.\nAllergan became the third-largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with Actavis in March.\nIts chief executive, Brent Saunders, has been eager to do deals, having first orchestrated the sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was initially CEO, to Actavis , then using the latter to seal the $66 billion purchase of Allergan.\nFollowing the Actavis tie-up, Allergan sold its generic drugs business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in July for $40.5 billion in cash and stock. And Saunders said after that he hoped to use those\nproceeds to do another large, "transformational" merger.\nIn its first full quarter after the Actavis deal, Allergan reported second-quarter revenue of $5.76 billion, led by $632 million in sales of wrinkle blocker Botox. Other top-selling drugs include dry eye treatment Restasis and Alzheimer's drug Namenda.\nPfizer recently reported third-quarter revenue of $12.1 billion, including $1.58 billion for its Prevnar pneumococcal vaccines and $947 million for pain drug Lyrica.\nWhile Pfizer wanted to buy AstraZeneca in part to boost Pfizer's pipeline of cancer drugs, a deal with Allergan would involve dermatology drugs and generics.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nTo learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:03.780295-06

Instead, the creation of the world's largest drug company will likely inspire more \nmergers and acquisitions. A Pfizer sign hangs on the outside of ...	12	\N	Pfizer-Allergan Merger Won't Lead to New, Innovative Drugs\nInstead, the creation of the world's largest drug company will likely inspire more mergers and acquisitions.\nThe $160 billion merger between Pfizer and Allergan has created the world's largest drug company. \nBy Steve Sternberg Nov. 24, 2015 | 5:41 p.m. EST + More\nIf romance writers covered the drug industry, they might say Pfizer married Ireland-based Allergan on the rebound.\nThe union of Pfizer and Allergan comes a year and a half after Pfizer was jilted by London-based drug-maker AstraZenica, maker of the blockbuster heart drug Crestor, following a whirlwind, seven-month courtship and an offer totaling approximately $104 billion. What made both companies especially appealing are their offshore addresses, which would allow Pfizer to benefit from lower corporate tax rates, potentially saving millions in U.S. taxes.\nThe $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan deal instantly turned the combined company, Pfizer Plc, into the world's largest drug maker. The windfall tax savings will likely give the new Pfizer a big competitive advantage against major U.S.-based drug firms with thousands of employees, such as Merck & Co., Eli Lilly and Company and Johnson & Johnson. What it will not do, experts say, is ramp up the development of innovative new drugs for consumers.\nThat's because the companies' research portfolios are so different. "The fields in which they're operating don't overlap much," says David Collis, of Harvard Business School. "Will putting these two companies together produce a better company than can deliver more and better drugs to more people? That's hard to see."\nIt will likely spur other mergers and acquisitions—possibly making AstraZenica an even more alluring target. Companies that once focused on developing drugs in-house will adopt Pfizer's model of finding attractive companies with promising drugs and buying them up. "I think it will increase the cost of health care," says Dr. Donald Conway, of the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College.\nDespite Pfizer's $7 billion to $8 billion investment in innovative drug research, Conway says, the company's drug development pipeline has been relatively weak. Viagra, the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug, emerged by chance, after subjects who took the drug as part of a failed pulmonary hypertension trial asked if they could continue to get it, he says.\n"They have not come up with great products," Conway says. "Viagra was serendipity. They stumbled into a market that didn't exist before they got there."\nFor much of its recent history, Pfizer's monumental success stems from astute mergers and acquisitions, including Warner-Lambert; Pharmacia, along with its blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex; Wyeth; and now Allergan, the maker of Botox, with a promising research and development pipeline, focusing mainly on eye-care, neuroscience, dermatology and gastrointestinal illnesses.\n"Pfizer is expert at first partnering with someone and then having a good, solid team of business analysts estimate what the asset is really worth. Then they buy the company. That's what happened with Celebrex ," Conway says. "G.D. Searle held the intellectual property. Searle merged with Pharmacia and Pfizer bought Pharmacia."\nIn an early-morning call with investors Monday, officers of the two drug-makers portrayed their deal as a boon for health care. Pfizer trumpeted Allergan's strength in drug classes Pfizer had "exited" due to weak returns. The new Pfizer inherits Allergan's pipeline of more than 70 experimental drugs, which includes a new line of biosimilars--essentially me-too versions of existing biotech drugs, says Mahud Hassan, director of the pharmaceutical management program at Rutgers University.\nThese drugs take advantage of existing biotech markets, Hassan says, though their profit margin is significantly smaller than standard generic drugs, which don't require biotechnology to produce.\nFor its part, Allergan cited quick access to Pfizer's global markets. And both firms are likely to benefit from operating synergies that will allow both to cut costs and likely trim back their workforces.\nThe tax savings give Pfizer a big competitive edge, because they free up cash to do other deals, such as buying small but innovative biotech or pharma companies.\nPfizer officials said that the relocated firm would have an effective tax rate of 18 percent in the first year after the deal closes, far less than the 25 percent rate the Pfizer now pays. The lower tax rates would free up billions of dollars trapped overseas giving Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," CEO Ian Read told participants on the call.\nPfizer will make the most of that money, Conway says. "Pfizer's analysts are expert at assessing an asset before they jump. They do a lot of jumping. They do it intelligently. And now they have a tax advantage to acquire smaller companies because they're competing at a more favorable tax rate."	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.110935-06

Credit Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\nWall Street has a late-in-the-week case of the Mondays.\nThe calendar says Thursday, but the bounty of deals announced today might make an investment banker think of Monday, the day when mega-mergers are usually unveiled.\nA day like today, when the value of deals outpaced the average “merger Monday,” might be called “transaction Thursday.”\nA pair of big deals helped the day stand out. Pfizer announced a $17 billion deal to acquire Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, and Rexam, the British aluminum can maker, said it was in talks to be acquired by Ball Corporation for about $8.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nBy DAVID GELLES and KATIE THOMAS\nIn its offer to buy Hospira, Pfizer is paying richly for what it believes will be a lucrative source of future revenue, drugs known as biosimilars.\nThe bid by Ball values Rexam at about $6.5 billion and would combine two of the world’s largest makers of beverage cans, whose customers include giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.\nA third big deal also was in the headlines today — the British telecommunications company BT said it had agreed to buy the mobile operator EE for $18.6 billion — but Thomson Reuters recorded that on an earlier date, when the two companies announced they were in talks.\nThe former British telecom monopoly agreed on Thursday to buy EE, Britain’s largest cellphone network, from Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany.\nIn total, according to the Thomson Reuters data, $25.7 billion of deals were recorded on Thursday.\nThat is significantly above average for this day of the week. Since early 2011, an average of $9 billion of deals were announced on Thursday, the data shows.\nAnd it’s even above the average value of Monday deals since 2011, which is $17.5 billion, according to the data.\nIn general, Monday beats Thursday by almost 2 to 1. Wall Street’s bankers are accustomed to using the weekend to put the finishing touches on deals before they are announced. An aggregate total of $3.7 trillion of deals have been announced on Monday since early 2011, compared with $1.9 trillion on Thursday.\nThe biggest “transaction Thursday” since 2011 came on Feb. 13, 2014, when $75.2 billion of deals were announced, a level that would be impressive even on a Monday.\nOn that day, Comcast announced a deal to buy Time Warner Cable for more than $45 billion in stock. That transaction has yet to close, and investors appear to be nervous about its prospects.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:03.818744-06

Pfizer investors will get one share of the new company for each of their shares or a portion of payment in cash from a $6 billion to $12 billion payment that will be made as part of the merger.\nThe transaction is currently valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of roughly $160 billion, including debt, based on the $32.18 per share closing price of Pfizer stock on Nov. 20, the companies said.\nThe deal terms call for the companies to combine under Allergan, which will be renamed Pfizer and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the PFE ticker symbol. The new combination would retain Allergan's legal and tax residency in Ireland. Pfizer would have its global operational headquarters in New York and its principal executive offices in Ireland.\nIan Read, Pfizer's CEO and chairman, will hold both those roles in the newly combined company. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will serve as president and chief operating officer of the new company.\nAdditionally, Pfizer's board is expected to have 15 directors, including all of Pfizer's 11 current directors and four current directors from Allergan.\nAs a result of the transaction, Pfizer said it plans to make a decision about a possible separation of the combined company's innovative and established operations into separate firms by the end of 2018.\nThe agreement is expected to face regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, and shareholders of both companies must vote on the transaction. Company officials said they expect the deal to close in the second half of 2016.\nThe agreement comes four days after the Obama administration stepped up its attack on corporate tax inversions — transactions in which a U.S. company reincorporates in a lower tax nation in a bid to cut its future tax bills while its leaving domestic operations in place.\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the restrictions, the second targeting inversions since 2014, were aimed at preventing inversions from eroding the nation's federal tax base. Congressional Democrats have generally backed the White House position. Republicans have said inversions should be addressed as part of a broader federal tax reform to lower the 39% U.S. top tax rate on business, the world's highest levy.\nPfizer officials predicted the Pfizer-Allergan combination would have an effective tax rate of 17% to 18% starting in the first year after the deal closes — well below the 25% rate the U.S. firm currently reports in financial filings.\nRead also said the deal would give Pfizer "substantially improved access to our existing and future cash flow," a reference to billions of dollars the company holds overseas because shifting the money to the U.S. would subject the funds to a substantial federal tax bite.\nHowever, the Treasury rules are not expected to affect the merger, in part because the transaction is structured to have Dublin-based Allergan, with a market capitalization of roughly $122 billion, acquire New York City-headquartered Pfizer, which has a market capitalization of approximately $200 billion.\nAllergan shareholders would hold an estimated 44% of the newly combined company's shares, with Pfizer investors holding 56%, company officials said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts. The level of Pfizer ownership falls below the 60% legal threshold needed for the deal to be officially deemed a tax inversion under the federal tax code and considered subject to the Treasury rules, said independent tax expert Robert Willens.\nTreasury officials declined to comment on the merger.\nRead pointedly referenced business industry and political discussions about the inversion issue and the wider question of federal tax reform as he and other Pfizer and Allergan officials fielded questions from financial analysts.\n"While reform progresses, we've assessed the legal, regulatory and political landscape and are moving forward with our strategy to combine these two great companies for the benefit of patients and to bring value to shareholders," said Read. "That is our obligation."\nSpeaking more generally about the merger, he said the agreement would facilitate discovery and development of new medications for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continue investments in the U.S.\nSaunders characterized the deal as a "highly strategic, value-enhancing transaction" and said it would give Allergan new or increased access to dozens of markets, including Japan and China.\n2434 CONNECT TWEET 301 LINKEDIN 123 COMMENT EMAIL MORE\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1jfM6qI	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.105513-06

I know ...	16	\N	The Pfizer-Allergan merger is good for the US – if you're in the 1%\nIf tax inversion deals like Pfizer’s continue, they seem likely to reinforce and even exacerbate existing economic inequality\nThe Pfizer World Headquarters in New York City on Tuesday. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton be damned! The Pfizer-Allergan merger – let’s call it “Pfallergan” – is good for America. Really it is. I know this, because Ian Read, Pfizer’s Scotland-born CEO, has told me so.\nRead’s argument might seem a bit of stretch. Assuming the record $155bn merger/tax inversion is completed as envisaged, Pfizer won’t be a US corporation any longer. Some $21bn in tax revenues it once generated for the United States might evaporate. Instead, a smaller portion will flow to the Irish government’s coffers, since “Pfallergan” will pay corporate tax there at a rate of 17% or 18%, instead of the 25% or so that it pays to the United States today. Those savings, Read insisted, will make it possible for Pfallergan to create more jobs in the United States and to reinvest its retained profits in new ventures.\nWhat’s not to like? Well Clinton and Sanders don’t like it for a start. Sanders has called the deal “a disaster for Americans”.\nNow the future of tax inversion deals - in which one company acquires another in a more attractive tax jurisdiction to escape the US corporate tax code – may hinge on whether politicians and the public can swallow Read’s argument or our those of our Democrat hopefuls.\nRead is making the case that the merger is actually about finding more resources “ to cure major illnesses for humanity ”. Of course, it’s also about generating more profits for Pfizer’s investors.\nAsk any M&A advisor, and they’ll tell you – vehemently – that one of the single largest factors affecting the financial success of a merger deal is the company’s tax rate. The lower it is, the higher the returns for shareholders; the easier it will be to absorb small hiccups and costs of integrating the two companies.\nAdd to that the peculiar set of circumstances facing US companies, and you’ve got a reasonable argument that the current status quo is almost driving CEOs like Read into the arms of overseas partners.\nWhether or not political critics like it, the corporate tax rate in the United States – as high as 35% – is higher than that in many other OECD nations. The icing on the cake is that the United States is virtually alone in taxing global income by its companies (its non-resident citizens). That has left companies with big foreign “cash mountains” in foreign subsidiaries that they are reluctant to repatriate and subject to what they view as hefty (translation: out of line with the rates charged by other nations) US taxes.\nIt was this latter consideration that drove Medtronic Inc to merge with Dublin-based Covidien at the beginning of this year in what was – at $49.9bn – then the largest tax inversion on record. Ironically, that particular transaction wasn’t even good for Medtronic’s shareholders, who got stuck with a big tax bill on capital gains related to the structure of the transaction.\nThe announcement of Pfallergan’s proposed creation accomplished the miracle of uniting (briefly) some politicians from both major US political parties in hostility to the transaction . Clinton blasted the deal, saying Pfizer is trying to wiggle out of paying its fair share of taxes and the merger “will leave US taxpayers holding the bag”. Republican Donald Trump was equally scathing, calling the inversion “disgusting”.\nThe initial reaction by Pfizer investors wasn’t that much more rapturous. Immediately after the announcement on Monday, Pfizer’s shares dropped 2.6% to trade at $31.33, while Allergan (technically the acquirer) saw its stock drop 3.4% to $301.72 a share, trading at 17% below the price that Allergan investors will get for their stock in the transaction (which already was a 30% premium above the price where the shares had traded before word of the negotiations first became public).\nFor the most part, that discount signals the riskiness of the transaction , given that the two companies are going to be trying to win the needed regulatory approvals during the height of the always-tumultuous presidential election season. The Treasury Department’s introduction of new measures to make the inversions more difficult may have ramifications for the deal\nThe Pfizer transaction makes the last estimate by Congress’s joint committee on taxation – that inversions will cost US taxpayers $19.5bn over the 10 years to 2014 – look hopelessly inadequate. As a result the question of inversion is almost guaranteed to emerge as a political hot potato in the presidential election season. With every month that passes, more and more household names have moved their headquarters abroad: Burger King pays its taxes to Canada; Chiquita Brands to Ireland.\nThe problem is that while CEOs are very, very clear about what they need to do to serve their constituency – cut how much they pay in corporate taxes, in order to maximize what they can reinvest in their businesses and distribute to their shareholders in the form of dividends, buybacks or other initiatives – politicians, in spite of their united opposition to inversions, can’t agree on how to tackle them.\nIdeally, the problem would be solved by a complete overhaul of the tax code. But how likely is that to happen, given the complete inability of Democrats and Republicans to agree even on basic priorities and guidelines, and the fact that Congress only narrowly avoids complete government shutdowns over more minor issues?\nThat leaves – for now – the Treasury Department and other bodies trying to pass rules to limit these inversions by trying to make them less financially appealing. The fact that the Pfizer transaction was announced in the wake of some of those seems to signal that CEOs still find them too lucrative to avoid.\nAnd that, in turn, raises a much broader dilemma for politicians. A CEO might argue that it doesn’t matter if taxpayers suffer a bit from the loss of corporate tax revenue, because those taxpayers also are investors, and they’ll benefit financially from that side of the transaction. Except that half of all Americans don’t invest in the stock market at all , even via mutual funds in 401(k) plans or other retirement vehicles, with half of those saying they don’t do so because they can’t afford to do so.\nIn other words, to the extent that tax inversions continue, they seem likely to reinforce and even exacerbate existing economic inequality. The burden created by the loss of corporate tax revenue would hit all taxpayers, but any benefits would flow disproportionately to those who possess the disposable income to invest. That’s precisely the same kind of pattern that we saw take shape beginning in the recovery from the financial and economic crisis in 2009, when 95% of the subsequent growth was captured by the wealthiest 1% of Americans .\nIt’s that issue that everyone should bear in mind when pondering what to do next. Because as long as the disparity between corporate tax rates in the United States and other developed countries exists, there’s going to be an incentive for other CEOs to do precisely what Pfizer’s Read just did: it’s as enticing as a laser pointer is to your new kitten. Either an outright ban or a new tax code would require Congressional action, and anything else will be ineffective. Given that presidential candidates have plans and proposals addressing absolutely anything you’d care to mention, inversions included, maybe it’s time to go a step further and grill the presidential candidates not on what they propose to do, but on how they plan to do it, and what steps they’ll take to get it through Congress. Or admit that we’ll just see more “Pfallergans”.\nThis discussion is closed for comments.\nWe’re doing some maintenance right now.

75	3	Pfizer, Allergan Said to Discuss Making Saunders CEO in Deal ...	http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/pfizer-allergan-said-to-discuss-making-saunders-ceo-in-merger	Nov 10, 2015 ... Pfizer Inc. and Allergan Plc are moving toward a plan to make Brent Saunders ... \nwhose name Actavis took after their 2014 merger agreement.	15	\N	Pfizer, Allergan Said to Discuss Making Saunders CEO in Deal\nEventual split would give Saunders faster-growing business\nPfizer Inc. and Allergan Plc are moving toward a plan to make Brent Saunders chief executive officer if the two drug giants reach a takeover agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.\nA combined Pfizer and Allergan would probably split into two companies eventually, with Allergan CEO Saunders taking the helm of the faster-growing business of new brand-name drugs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are private. The other unit would contain older products at or near the end of their patent lives.\nThe largest U.S. drugmaker said last month it was in “preliminary friendly discussions” about combining with Allergan. An acquisition of Allergan, which is incorporated in Dublin and run from New Jersey, would give Pfizer a low-tax legal address abroad and valuable drugs like the Botox anti-wrinkle treatment. The companies could agree on a deal by Thanksgiving, celebrated in the U.S. on Nov. 26, people familiar with the matter said last week.\nPfizer is led by Ian Read, 62, who has been CEO since 2010. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion and Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur declined to comment.\nThe idea of a Pfizer breakup was popularized in 2012, when a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested that the company might be worth more in pieces than as a whole. Since then, whether or not the company would pull the lever to do so has been the subject of constant speculation, though Pfizer has said it couldn’t happen until at least 2017. Allergan itself is in the process of a split under Saunders’s leadership, after agreeing in July to sell its generics business to Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nSaunders, 45, spent his first dozen years in the health-care industry largely in compliance positions. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and the Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, he became a CEO for the first time in 2010 with Bausch & Lomb Inc. Three years later he sold the eye-care company to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. for $8.7 billion.\nAfter Bausch & Lomb, activist investor Carl Icahn endorsed Saunders becoming CEO of Forest Laboratories Inc. Soon after, Actavis Plc bought Forest and Saunders became CEO of the combined entity, with the acquirer’s chief executive Paul Bisaro assuming the role of executive chairman. They both remain in place at Allergan, whose name Actavis took after their 2014 merger agreement.\nRead took the helm at Pfizer after a turbulent period for the drugmaker that ended with the ouster of CEO Jeff Kindler. A chemical engineer by training, he joined Pfizer in 1978 as an accountant, then rose through the drugmaker’s ranks to run its worldwide pharmaceutical businesses. Since Dec. 5, 2010, when Read was named CEO, the stock has doubled from $16.72 to more than $33.\nSince taking over, he has overhauled the company’s R&D operations, cutting struggling programs like allergy and respiratory drugs to focus on cancer, neurology, inflammation, vaccines and immunology.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.124825-06
74	3	The Pfizer-Allergan Merger: From Serial Acquirer to Serial Offender ...	http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/12/03/the-pfizer-allergan-merger-from-serial-acquirer-to.aspx	5 days ago ... Pfizer is giving away too much to Allergan shareholders in order to carry out their \ntax-advantaged merger.	14	\N	The Pfizer-Allergan Merger: From Serial Acquirer to Serial Offender\nPfizer is giving away too much to Allergan shareholders in order to carry out their tax-advantaged merger.\nDec 3, 2015 at 2:07PM\nU.S. stocks are lower on Thursday afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) down 1.14% and down 1.25%, respectively, at 1 p.m. ET. Shares of pharmaceuticals  Pfizer and Allergan PLC are displaying similar losses (down 0.94% and 1.38%, respectively).\nLeerink Partners, an investment bank specializing in the healthcare sector, published a report on Tuesday that looks at which of Pfizer's or Allergan's shareholders are getting the better deal in their proposed $160 billion tie-up. Their conclusion ought to stoke concerns about the merits of the deal for Pfizer's owners.\nLeerink puts the value of the post-merger company at $37 to $38 per share based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, which is right in line with the company's $37 price target. According to the analyst, this suggests "most of the near-term value captured by the deal is going to AGN [Allergan] shareholders."\nIn pursuing Allergan, Pfizer was manifestly motivated to complete a deal that would enable it to transfer its domicile to a lower tax jurisdiction (a so-called "corporate inversion"). There was a very short list of potential targets large enough to ensure that Pfizer shareholders end up with fewer than 60% of the shares of the new company, a requirement in order to achieve the optimal tax treatment.\nThe circle narrows Roughly speaking, using today's market capitalization for Pfizer and excluding the value of synergies, the target would need to be worth at least $134 billion. As of today, there are only six pharmaceutical companies in the world other than Pfizer that meet that criterion. Actually, with a market value of $124 billion, Allergan doesn't meet that criterion today (don't forget those synergies, though!).\nThe list of targets got shorter in May, when Pfizer abandoned its proposed $118 billion acquisition of AstraZeneca plc this year, a deal that offered the same benefit. (The current proposed deal has Pfizer shareholders owning roughly 56% of the combined company.)\nPfizer's single-minded ambition to carry out an inversion has forced management to take their eyes off other key considerations in assessing the attractiveness of a mega-deal.\nFrom serial acquirer to serial offender It was not always thus. This column has previously referred to the Boston Consulting Group's 2004 report, Growing Through Acquisitions: The Successful Acquisition Record of Acquisitive Growth Strategies , which identifies Pfizer as a model of the successful acquirer, writing that "Pfizer is perhaps the most dramatic example in the pharmaceutical industry of a company that has built a strong competitive position and substantial shareholder value, at least in part by means of aggressive acquisition."\nA successful acquisition-driven growth strategy ultimately sows the seeds of its failure, as the acquiring company is forced to pursue larger and larger targets to sustain it. At some point, the size imperative crowds out other considerations in evaluating potential transactions. In other words, size matters...too much. That was the case with the $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, and history is at risk of repeating itself with this latest deal.\nThe $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known "Social Security secrets" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually.

61	3	Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S. | Reuters	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-m-a-pfizer-idUSKCN0SN01P20151030	Oct 30, 2015 ... Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they \nwere in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the ...	1	\N	By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson\nPfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.\nBoth New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.\nAllergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.\nPfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\nA spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n"Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas," Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: "The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them."\nFrom the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.\nSMOOTHER PATH\n"These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore," he said in a statement. "We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."\nBillionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.\nAnalysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.\nCredit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.\nEarlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.\n"Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses," Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. "I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back."\nPfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent.\nGiven that both sides characterized the talks as "friendly," Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.\n"It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca," said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. "The hurdle will really be the price."\nMoody's Investor Service said the deal would have "credit positive implications for both companies."\nA tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.\nRead said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.\nPfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines.\nAllergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for $40.5 billion.\nCASH FROM BOTOX\nA purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.\nIt would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.\nAllergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.\nPfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.\nSince the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.\nThe deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.\nApart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.\nBy Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOther large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.\n(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb )\nTraders gather at the post that trades Allergan stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange October 29, 2015.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:03.753236-06

Johnson November 23 Follow @carolynyjohnson\nAllergan's $160 billion purchase of Pfizer gives it a lineup of fast growing drugs and a lower tax rate. The merger will create the world's largest drug maker in a controversial inversion deal. (Reuters)\nPfizer and Allergan on Monday morning announced they would merge in a massive, $160 billion deal that will create the world's largest drugmaker, producing treatments as varied as Lipitor and Botox.\nThe deal is structured as a reverse merger, with smaller Dublin-based Allergan buying New York-based Pfizer, and it is likely to renew concerns over "inversions," where U.S. companies are bought by or merge with foreign firms in order to reduce U.S. corporate tax burdens. In a press release, Pfizer said the combined company would generate more than $2 billion in savings over the first three years and would enjoy a tax rate of 17 to 18 percent -- far less than Pfizer's current corporate tax rate of 25 percent.\nJust days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department issued rules seeking to crack down on these types of deals, which President Obama has labeled " unpatriotic ."\n[ Pfizer-Allergan merger shows why it's so hard to stop tax-dodging companies ]\nLast year, several such inversion deals fell apart and sparked scrutiny of corporate tax loopholes. In October 2014, Chicago-based AbbVie and Dublin-based Shire  called off a $54 billion inversion deal after the Treasury issued new rules . That same month, Raleigh, N.C.-based Salix Pharmaceuticals and the Italian firm, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA terminated a reverse merger , citing changes in the political environment.\nIn a call with analysts, Pfizer chief executive Ian Read said that Pfizer appreciates the attention to inversions from politicians, presidential candidates, and Treasury but decided to proceed.\n"On the political risk, we've assessed this deal looking at the present regulations, the new notices, and all the information we can glean, and we believe this deal is a great deal for shareholders, both of Allergan and Pfizer," Read said.\nAs measured by annual revenue, Pfizer is more than twice the size of Allergan -- Pfizer reported $49.6 billion in revenues in 2014 , while Allergan, which recently merged with Actavis , projected a combined $23 billion in revenues for 2015. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and create a combined company with an operating cash flow of more than $25 billion by 2018. Current Allergan shareholders will own 44 percent of the combined company, while Pfizer shareholders will own 56 percent -- a careful division of ownership that is structured to avoid triggering additional taxes. Federal rules subject inverted companies to more taxes if the shareholders of the U.S. company own at least 60 percent of the shares.\nGustav Ando, research director for IHS Life Sciences, a business information and consulting company, said that he thought the deal was carefully structured and likely to be approved, but added that it may receive even more scrutiny due to the current public and political outrage over high drug prices for the pharmaceutical industry.\n"This merger isn’t meant to benefit patients; it isn’t meant to innovate in any kind of way. It’s basically a tax inversion strategy, and certainly the benefits won’t be passed on to consumers," Ando said. "It's pretty easy at the moment to paint the pharmaceutical industry in a negative light and this certainly doesn’t do anything to help the cause. It definitely increases the reputational risks to the industry."\n[Read more:  Specialty drugs now cost more than the median household income ]\nThe combined company, which will be called Pfizer plc, will bring together a huge U.S. pharmaceutical company best known for iconic drugs like the cholesterol-fighting Lipitor and erectile dysfunction medication Viagra with Allergan, which is best known for making wrinkle-smoothing Botox.\nAllergan is technically buying Pfizer due to the structure of the deal. Before the merger, Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each share they own. Pfizer stockholders will receive one share for each share they own. The new company will be combined under Allergan plc, which will then rename itself Pfizer plc. The company will maintain its global headquarters in New York, but its key executive offices will be in Ireland, the statement said.\nIn a letter to Sen. Mitch McConnell, Pfizer's chief executive, Read, reiterated the combined company's deep commitment to the U.S., noting that when the deal is expected to close there will be 40,000 employees spread across 25 states.\n"We believe this will be good for patients and for U.S. competitiveness," Read wrote to McConnell.\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders both put out statements denouncing the deal.\n"This proposed merger, and so-called ‘inversions’ by other companies, will leave U.S. taxpayers holding the bag," Clinton said. "As President, I will fight to reform our tax system to reward growth, innovation, and job creation here in the United States. "\nSanders said the merger would be punishing for consumers in America who already pay higher prices for prescription drugs than the rest of the world.\n"The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority," Sanders said.\nWhile the merger will create a behemoth pharmaceutical company, most industry watchers expect the growth to precede a major split in which Pfizer will spin off its business into two separate companies. One company is expected to focus on research and development of new, innovative drugs, and the other will focus on the pipeline of generic products.\n"Probably, the company will now be splitting itself up. That’s the part of the strategy," said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School. "They’re pretty clear about it -- it’s bulking up in order to slim down."\nAndo noted that follows a larger trend in the pharmaceutical industry, in which pharmaceutical companies that have grown or acquired different lines of business spin off companies, too. For example, Baxter International Inc. this year spun off its biopharmaceutical drug business into a separate company, Baxalta.\nDimitri Drone, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that buying and selling has become the "new normal" in the pharmaceutical industry, with companies buying up others and also splitting off specific parts of the business.\n"Joining forces with Pfizer matches our leading products in seven high growth therapeutic areas and our robust R&D pipeline with Pfizer’s leading innovative and established businesses, vast global footprint and strength in discovery and development research to create a new biopharma leader," Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said in a statement.\nMore from Wonkblog:\nCarolyn Johnson is a reporter covering the business of health.

79	3	Is This The Biggest Roadblock to a Pfizer-Allergan Merger? -- The ...	http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/17/the-biggest-roadblock-to-a-pfizer-allergan-deal-ma.aspx	Nov 17, 2015 ... Pfizer's legacy products may get left out in the cold if the drugmaker goes through \nwith a proposed merger with Botox-maker Allergan.	19	\N	Is This The Biggest Roadblock to a Pfizer-Allergan Merger?\nPfizer's legacy products may get left out in the cold if the drugmaker goes through with a proposed merger with Botox-maker Allergan.\nNov 17, 2015 at 8:29AM\nPfizer ( NYSE:PFE ) and Allergan ( NYSE:AGN ) are reportedly discussing the possibility of a friendly merger between the two pharma giants that could take place before year's end. This proposed deal has drawn broad interest in the media because of the so-called 'tax inversion' component, whereby Pfizer would lower its 26% effective tax rate by relocating to Ireland, after buying the Botox-maker. \nSource: Flickr via user Oceanview Med Spa\nHowever, I think the media has missed the real story, and perhaps the biggest roadblock to a merger, by blowing the tax inversion angle out of proportion. Here's why. \nThese merger talks were not spurred by Pfizer's tax problem The impetus behind a Pfizer-Allergan merger would, point blank, be growth -- not taxes. Because of the loss of exclusivity for several former blockbuster drugs, Pfizer's top-line has been stagnating for several quarters now, despite the launch of multiple new growth products (more on this later).\nAt last count, Pfizer's total revenues through the first nine months of 2015, for example, declined by 5% compared to the same period a year ago. A quick look under the hood, however, reveals that the main problem is Pfizer's Global Established Pharmaceuticals (GEP) segment, which saw its sales slip by 13%, on an operational basis, in the third quarter, relative to a year ago. By contrast, Pfizer's Innovative Products business saw its sales gap up by 21%, on an operational basis, in the same period. \nSource: Pfizer\nTo solve this problem, Pfizer could chose to pair its Innovative Products with Allergan's branded pharma business (following the latter's divestiture of its generic segment) to form a streamlined, ultra-high growth company that would sport a four-headed monster consisting of Botox, Prevnar 13, Ibrance, and Eliquis. This new company, in theory, should be able to generate 20% plus growth on its top and bottom-lines for several years running. In short, this proposed merger makes sense from a growth perspective and any tax benefits would simply be icing on the cake. \nBut here's the problem... It's no secret that Pfizer wants to split its Established Products and Innovative Products segments into two separate entities, and it only makes sense to pair the Innovative segment with Allergan for the reasons outlined above.\nBy carving out the Innovative Products business via a merger with Allergan, though, Pfizer's Established Products business would be left in no man's land. As I mentioned previously, this particular segment is experiencing double-digit sales declines because of falling sales for drugs like Celebrex and Zyvox. And even the recent acquisition of Hospira isn't enough to reverse this trend. With over $18 billion in sales in the last nine months, the sheer size of this business also implies that it can't be easily repackaged and sold off to a company specializing in generics.\nWhile this unit is still throwing off tons of positive free cash, Allergan's management probably doesn't want to take on this problem. After all, it would turn a large company with a rapidly growing top-line into an absolutely bloated megagiant with a market cap of over $300 billion and a flat top-line. That's not a smart business move, especially after the company struck a deal not long ago to jettison its own generic business in order to focus on branded products. In other words, this merger may ultimately hinge on what Pfizer's management decides to do with its legacy products.  \nWhat's next? Although the media has honed in on the tax inversion issue, I don't think it will play much of a role if a deal ultimately goes through. The bigger problem is the fate of Pfizer's Established Products business that's literally sinking under an avalanche of patent problems. Not many investors are going to line up to buy into a company with a plunging top and bottom-line after all.\nPfizer's management therefore has to make an extremely tough call on a business that is still generating boatloads of free cash, but no revenue growth to speak of. And that's a much more pressing issue, at least in my mind, than shaving a few points off of Pfizer's effective tax rate.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

On Thursday, Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc confirmed that they are in discussions \nabout a potential acquisition that could be the industry's largest ...	21	\N	On Thursday, Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc confirmed that they are in discussions about a potential acquisition that could be the industry’s largest in history. Pharmaceutical companies set a new record for the value of deals struck in the first half of 2015, and executives and analysts don’t expect the fever to fade. Getty/Spencer Platt\nPharmaceutical companies are striking deals at a dizzying rate. The collective value of 2015’s deals is on pace to break the previous record, which was set only last year. Analysts and industry experts say this fervor is a product of shifts in the industry’s competitive landscape and executives’ acquired taste for more focused and streamlined business models, even at the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies.\nIn the latest round of negotiations, the Wall Street Journal reported  Thursday that Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc have begun talks about an acquisition that could be the industry’s largest in history given Allergan’s market cap of $113 billion. Allergan confirmed the companies were in “preliminary friendly discussions” in a statement posted to its website.\nThe announcement comes even while Allergan completes the sale of its generics unit to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in a $40.5 billion deal announced just three months ago. Pfizer kicked off 2015 by announcing that it would buy Hospira Inc., which produces injectable drugs and biosimilars, for $17 billion. If this latest purchase is also completed, Pfizer will welcome brand name specialty drugs including anti-wrinkle Botox injections and Namenda for dementia to its already-expanding portfolio. \nSuch fondness for acquisitions reflects the rapid growth of deals taking place across the pharmaceutical industry this year. In the first half of 2015, pharmaceutical companies struck $211.7 billion worth of deals compared with $205.4 billion in the first half of 2014, which wound up being a record year in both the volume and value of agreements.\nTo some degree, this trend fuels itself. “I think you just get a little bit of a feeding frenzy going on,” Max Jacobs, a biotech analyst at Edison Investment Research , says. “You're worried that the companies you would ideally like to take over in two to three years might be taken over so you have to get them now.”\nBut groupthink isn't the only factor at play.  Mergermarket reports that pharmaceutical executives say the single largest driver for recent deals is to reduce costs through operational efficiency and to seek a lower tax rate in countries other than the U.S. If the Pfizer-Allergan purchase proceeds, Pfizer could claim Allergan’s Dublin headquarters as its own and save the company millions of dollars a year in corporate taxes. Ireland’s tax rate only charges companies 12.5 percent of profits. The U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate of any country, and companies in the U.S. can pay up to 40 percent in some states.\n“If they became an Irish-organized company, the taxes could easily go down to half of what they are today,” Albert Wertheimer , a pharmaco-economic expert at Temple University, says. \nMany of Pfizer’s competitors have completed so-called tax inversion deals in recent years, and CEO Ian Read said on Thursday at a Wall Street Journal event that he thinks the New York City-based drugmaker is suffering as a result. “I feel we are at a tremendous disadvantage right now in that race,” he said.\nIn addition to earning a more favorable tax code, large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focusing resources on a few key areas rather than spreading themselves across specialties ranging from animal health to cosmetics. Increasingly, management teams are choosing to become the best company in two or three areas such as cancer or neurological disorders, rather than funding research teams that try to find breakthrough treatments for every disease at once. Jamie Davies , head of healthcare and pharmaceutical analysis at BMI Research, says this “de-diversification” is another factor fueling the current deal-making frenzy.\nPfizer is among the companies that have adopted this strategy. Read has even said the company is considering splitting into two or more entities focused on patented and off-patent drugs to slim down its operations and maximize value to shareholders. “I think the consolidation is being driven by companies that have the cash and want to accelerate their portfolio,” he said at Thursday’s event.\nLes Funtleyder , healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management, says acquiring Allergan could be one way to ensure each division is strong enough to stand on its own before the company breaks up.\n“You want as many products as you can going through the same channel to leverage efficiencies of scale,” he says. “So the bigger you are, the easier it is to operate in various product classes and therapeutic classes.”\nAt the same time, many large companies have found that it’s often faster and cheaper to acquire a smaller company with a promising pipeline of potential drugs that are almost ready to hit the market than do the hard work of developing drugs in-house from scratch. While most pharmaceutical companies still fund robust research departments, they are increasingly looking elsewhere for products that can complement their specialties.\n“You can never have enough pipeline because products fail so often,” Funtleyder says.\nCompanies do need cash to make these purchases, and the Pfizer-Allergan deal should expand Pfizer’s financial base substantially, making it easier to be aggressive and competitive in its acquisitions. Such heft also gives the company more influence when it negotiates with governments to set drug prices outside of the U.S. or approaches suppliers with bulk orders.\n “I think everybody's trying to bulk up to have a better position to deal with the Affordable Care Act, which brought another 10 million people to the market,” Weirtheimer says. “There's profit pressure everywhere.”\nLow interest rates that barely outpace inflation have also spurred companies to be bolder in their courtship of competitors and smaller firms, as they weigh the investment potential of keeping money in a bank versus purchasing a company that can generate profits.\n“You get zero money if you put it in the bank, or you get something if you buy a company,” Funtleyder says. “Zero percent interest rates have led to misallocation of capital.”\nOf course, not every deal is a merger or acquisition. As companies strive to specialize and focus their missions, more have chosen to swap or sell off divisions that deviate from their core missions. Earlier this year, Novartis completed the trade of its vaccines division to GlaxoSmithKline in exchange for GSK’s oncology group. Companies are also entering into collaborative deals to with partners that have similar interests to cooperate in commercializing and marketing treatments in ways that neither could achieve on its own.  \n“It’s almost impossible to discover a drug and take it through clinical trials on your own – at the very least, you need to partner,” Davies says.\nPharmaceutical executives recently surveyed by Mergermarket said they expect the fury of deal-making to hold in the second half of 2015. But Wertheimer is skeptical of its long-term sustainability, and expects it to die down.\n“Merger is not very sustainable. Acquisition of another company isn’t very sustainable because you'll see a huge bolus of increase this year, and then what do you do next year? You have to buy another company,” he says.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.985571-06

Read previously tried to move Pfizer's corporate headquarters offshore by buying Britain’s AstraZeneca in a controversial $119 billion takeover bid. That bid failed, in part, because of objections by U.S. and U.K. lawmakers.\nPresident Obama has repeatedly called such overseas mergers and tax-evasion tactics “unpatriotic.” The Treasury Department just passed new rules intended to stop U.S. corporations from buying foreign firms as a way to evade taxes. In this deal, however, Ireland-based Allergan is buying Pfizer, even though Pfizer is the larger company. That gambit allows it to evade the new Treasury rules.\nThe New York Times reported that Pfizer “kept $74 billion in earnings offshore last year to avoid” paying U.S. corporate taxes.\nSanders has repeatedly criticized the greed-driven approach exemplified by the Pfizer merger, most recently at last week’s Georgetown University speech where he described what democratic socialism meant to him and would mean for the nation if he were elected president.\nSanders singled out the U.S. drug industry for price-gouging consumers, describing its notorious lobbying achievement of getting legislation passed barring federal officials who run Medicare, the government health program for seniors, from negotiating for lower prices.\nSteven Rosenfeld covers national political issues for AlterNet, including America's retirement crisis, democracy and voting rights, and campaigns and elections.

We cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base.”\nClinton went on to say that she would soon be rolling out specific plans to prevent inversions and to close other loopholes in the tax code so firms can’t “game the international tax system.” She added that she wants Congress to act immediately to make sure that large corporations pay their “fair share” and called on regulators to “look hard at stronger actions they can take.”\nThe U.S. has in recent years seen a growth in the number of tax inversions, in which an American company buys a foreign one and officially moves abroad to take advantage of a foreign country’s lower tax rate, even while leaving its headquarters and operations back in the U.S.\nRELATED:  Competitor to offer $1 pill after Turing price hike outrage\nBurger King and Fruit of the Loom are some of the better known brands to legally move abroad, but pharmaceutical firms have been among the most aggressive in exploiting the move.\nSanders said the Pfizer-Allergan deal would be “disaster” and called on the Obama administration to stop the merger, which would create the largest drug-maker in the world. “The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said in a statement.\n“The Obama administration has the authority to stop this merger, and it should exercise that authority. Congress also must pass real tax reform that demands that profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” he added.\nChallenger Martin O’Malley also announced opposition to the deal and tried to earn points for fighting a similar deal as the governor of Maryland. “Leadership is about actions, not just words, and leading with our principles. I oppose the Pfizer merger now, just as I opposed the last Pfizer merger as Governor of Maryland, because it would have cost Maryland jobs and sent corporate taxes abroad,” he said in a statement.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.” Sen. Bernie Sanders It’s a similar line to the one the White House has taken. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the Treasury Department has tried to crack down on inversions, and managed to make them somewhat more difficult, but said Congress needs to act to make more sweeping changes.\nLess expected is that they have an ally in Trump. “The fact that Pfizer is leaving our country with a tremendous loss of jobs is disgusting,” Trump said  in a statement to Business Insider .  \nOther Republicans haven’t spoken out about the deal. In the past, however, they have tended to cite inversions as evidence of the need to reduce the corporate tax rate, not as an example of corporate greed. \n“We can rail all we want about how unpatriotic it is and how angry we are that Pfizer is selling to another company and they’re going to move outside of America,” Florida Sen. Rubio told CNBC last month. “They have a legal obligation to their shareholders to maximize profits, as long as they can do so legally.”\nDemocrats — and Trump — oppose Pfizer merger	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:05.139714-06

As Bloomberg reports, options traders are paying record prices for bullish GSK options--and this after the British drugmaker lost $11 billion off its market cap in less than three months.\nMuch of that interest has to do with chatter about a Pfizer takeover, traders told the news service. But it's not the only factor.\nThere's also some speculation about CEO Andrew Witty , who looks vulnerable these days, what with sales of GSK's top-selling Advair sliding downhill, and follow-up respiratory meds Anoro and Breo so far failing to take up much slack.\n"A lot of this is down to rumors about a merger with Pfizer," Tavira Monaco Sam trader Kari Olsen told Bloomberg . "There is also talk that if the CEO does go, the stock can spike up some 10% on the back of people thinking that the company can then start restructuring and sell some assets."\nWitty's answer to his Advair predicament, revealed along with first-quarter earnings earlier this month, is high-volume sales of lower-priced products such as vaccines, OTC meds and consumer health staples, such as toothpaste.\nMakes sense; the company just doubled down on vaccines and the consumer business in its multibillion-dollar asset swap with Novartis ( $NVS ). But the idea wasn't popular with some investors, who see that kind of slow, steady growth as, well, too slow.\nAs Bloomberg notes, an average of 800 Glaxo options changed hands every day in May. That's 17% more than in April--more than double the usual daily amount over the past two years.\nOf course, deal talk can be just that. Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert suggested last week that GSK might be a nice solution to Pfizer's deal needs; the U.S. company may have failed to snag AstraZeneca ( $AZN ), but GSK's ability to beef up Pfizer's vaccines and consumer health operations would be worth the effort, Gilbert said in an investor note. Plus, the buy would boost Pfizer's earnings by up to 16% beginning next year.\nGilbert's suggestion touched off debate, of course, with other analysts saying a bid for GSK would be every bit as problematic as Pfizer's failed offer for AstraZeneca. Perhaps more so, even. Louis Capital Markets analyst Ben Kelly now tells Bloomberg that a Pfizer-GSK merger is unlikely for all the reasons the AZ deal didn't make.\n"Glaxo is a U.K. national champion--a bid for the company would cause a rehash of all that political and nationalistic furor," Kelly told the news service. "There would also be political pressure against a deal in the U.S. as it's very clear there would be a strong tax-inversion rationale, and we have elections coming up there next year."\n- read the Bloomberg story\n| Presented by: Veeva Systems | December 10th, 2015\nJoin us for this webinar to learn how the Veeva TMF Maturity Model for Life Sciences can help you evaluate your TMF operating model and create a strategy that propels your organization along the TMF continuum.

Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan will merge, creating the world's biggest drug-maker by sales. Mark Lennihan/AP\nThe U.S. drug giant Pfizer and its smaller rival Allergan have agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by sales.\nThe $160 billion deal is the largest example so far of a corporate inversion, in which a U.S. company merges with a foreign company and shifts its domicile overseas in order to lower its corporate taxes.\nBecause Allergan is based in Dublin, New York-based Pfizer can move its corporate home to Ireland, where the official tax rate is lower. But it will essentially remain the same company, with the same name, CEO and even the same stock ticker symbol.\nThe deal, which was approved unanimously by the boards of the two companies on Sunday, brings together the makers of Viagra and Botox, creating a drug industry powerhouse, The Wall Street Journal reports . The newspaper adds:\n"The merger will create a pharmaceutical behemoth, with top-selling products including Pfizer's Prevnar pneumonia vaccine and Allergan's anti-wrinkle treatment Botox and industry-topping R&D budget. The company's drugs and vaccines would cover a range of diseases, from Alzheimer's to cancer, eye health to rheumatoid arthritis."\nIn a statement , Pfizer CEO Ian Read said the deal "will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world":\n"Allergan's businesses align with and enhance Pfizer's businesses, creating best-in-class, sustainable, innovative and established businesses that are poised for growth.\n"Through this combination, Pfizer will have greater financial flexibility that will facilitate our continued discovery and development of new innovative medicines for patients, direct return of capital to shareholders, and continued investment in the United States, while also enabling our pursuit of business development opportunities on a more competitive footing within our industry."\nThe merger is likely to be controversial and increase pressure on Congress to take on the inversion trend.\nThe Treasury Department proposed new rules to make inversions somewhat tougher to pull off several days ago, but the Obama administration says congressional action is needed to really address the issue.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:06.021862-06

The merged company is expected to have an adjusted effective tax rate of 17 to 18 percent in the first full year after the transaction is closed, compared with Pfizer’s expected 25 percent effective tax rate for 2015, according to a Pfizer spokesman.\nClinton called upon regulators to see if they can take stronger actions to prevent corporations from moving earnings overseas, and she urged Congress to “act immediately to make sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share."\n“Republicans should stop trying to tilt the tax code even further in favor of the super wealthy and the largest corporations and join us in supporting these necessary reforms on behalf of U.S. taxpayers,” the former Secretary of State said.\nSanders criticized the merger not just because it would allow Pfizer to “hide its profits overseas” but also because it would hurt those who need prescription medications.\n“The Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” the Vermont Senator said.\nSanders added that the Obama administration should exercise its authority to halt the merger and that “Congress also must pass real tax reform that demands that profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes.”\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley called the merger "fundamentally unfair."\n \n“Recent mergers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries will reduce competition, reduce choice, and raise prices for American consumers," O'Malley said. "As President, I will aggressively enforce our antitrust laws to counter dramatic price increases in healthcare, while fighting to close corporate tax loopholes that allow giant companies to dodge taxes and offshore their profits."\n \nAnchor_menu Home Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Contact Advertise Subscriptions\nThe Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax\nThe contents of this site are ©2015 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:06.027775-06
82	3	Pfizer and Allergan combine in biggest drug merger ever - Nov. 23 ...	http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/23/investing/pfizer-allergan-merger/	Nov 23, 2015 ... A merger deal between Pfizer and Allergan could be the largest merger of drug \nmakers in history.	22	\N	Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have changed.\nPfizer and Allergan combine in biggest drug merger ever\nAvoiding U.S. corporate taxes\nIn one of the biggest corporate deals ever, Pfizer and Allergan announced Monday that they would combine to create the world's largest pharmaceutical giant.\nThe merger, which still needs regulatory approval, would bring blockbuster drugs like Pfizer's Lyrica, Enbrel and Viagra and Allergan's Botox and Restasis under one corporate roof.\nConsumers probably don't have to worry about big price hikes for these drugs, though.\nThere has been an intense focus on drug prices from presidential candidates after one drug company raised the price of a drug used by AIDS patients by more than 5,500%.\nBut the prices of blockbuster drugs have typically not gone up that much when two large pharmaceutical companies merge. Instead, the huge price spikes are usually by smaller companies that own drugs for rare diseases.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan merger, worth approximately $160 billion, would be the second-largest of all time, according to Dealogic, behind only the 1999 merger of two telecommunications firms.\nThe companies said they expected the deal to close by the end 2016.\nAllergan ( AGN ) , based in Dublin, is best known as the maker of Botox.\nThe combined company would top industry leaders Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Novartis ( NVS ) in terms of sales and market value.\nThe mega deal is also the latest example of the massive wave of consolidation in health care. Drug makers, insurers, hospitals and pharmacies have raced to bulk up in recent years as the business landscape has been altered by Obamacare and an aging population.\nThe Pfizer-Allergan announcement is expected to be controversial in political circles.\nThe deal would move New York-based Pfizer ( PFE ) to Ireland -- making it the latest merger that will let a U.S. company slash its federal corporate tax bill.\nPfizer has been openly critical of the U.S. corporate tax rate. Last year, when it tried unsuccessfully to acquire British drug maker AstraZeneca, Pfizer didn't hide the fact that tax savings were one of the main drivers.\nMergers like Pfizer-Allergan are known as tax inversions. In such deals, bigger American companies buy smaller foreign ones and then switch their headquarters (at least on paper) to the location of the smaller company.\nBurger King made headlines last year when it bought Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons and moved its address to Canada.\nInversions are legal but have been criticized, particularly by Democrats, as a way for companies to beat Uncle Sam.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department unveiled new rules Thursday to make it harder for companies to do inversions. But without Congressional action, the Treasury rules were not expected alone to stop a Pfizer-Allergan tie up.\n--CNNMoney's Paul R.

The deal is being positioned as Irish-based Allergan taking over Pfizer, with the merged entity resident in Ireland for tax purposes. This will save billions of dollars in future tax bills, but do little for new drug discovery.\nPfizer boss Ian Read claims the deal is motivated by more than just tax, but analysts and politicians are unconvinced © Matt Dunham/AP/Press Association Images\nPfizer, which will retain its operational headquarters in the US, flagged expected savings of $2 billion from operating expenses, with a third coming from R&D. Pfizer today invests $7 billion in R&D, the vast majority of which is in the US.\n‘Pfizer said last quarter that it was going to reduce all costs. One of the easiest to reduce is the tax liability. That is what it has done,’ says Steve Brozak , president of WBB Securities in San Diego, US. The move will bulk up revenue and cut expenses but will do nothing to add to the drug pipeline. The deal sidesteps the US treasury’s tightened rules designed to deter companies from pursuing ‘inversion’ deals to move their bases abroad and reduce their tax rates. It is not technically an inversion, since Allergan is nominally doing the buying, but will massively cut Pfizer’s US tax bill – from 25% to 17% by some estimates.\nThere are other benefits to the deal, according to industry observers. Analyst Alastair McCaig at IG in London, UK, says the $6–8 billion of tax savings is not to be sniffed at, but points to other drivers. ‘There is a good fit between the businesses,’ he says.\nThere is not a lot of overlap between the two companies’ drug portfolios, which makes them complementary. Allergan is strong in aesthetics – centred around Botox (onabotulinum toxin A); eye care; anti-infectives; gastrointestinal and neurology – areas Pfizer exited or de-prioritised some years ago.  \nUpsides, but not new drugs\nMerger and acquisition activity by Pfizer was not unexpected. ‘Pfizer needed to replenish its basket of approved drugs. It needed to buy products that were already available on the market, specifically in the US, where the profit premiums are so much greater,’ says McCaig. ‘Part of the reason is that in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies effectively battened down the hatches and cut costs. They were reluctant to spend money, reduced head count and cut back on R&D. And now they find themselves with this shortfall or inability to produce new drugs.’\n‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens’ While Pfizer invests in significant in-house R&D, Allergan has tended to buy potential targets in the drug discovery phase. ‘Unlike the AstraZeneca case, this probably won’t have a significant impact on R&D operations,’ says Aris Angelis from the London School of Economics, UK. ‘There might be some reasonable workforce optimisation, but there is not much therapeutic area complementarity between the two companies and Allergan’s R&D should not suffer much.’\nThat said, mergers are not known for driving new drug discovery. ‘I would not expect a significant increase in innovative output from the combined new company,’ adds Angelis, who criticised  last year’s proposed AstraZeneca–Pfizer deal , and recently  blogged  about the proposed Allergan–Pfizer embrace. \nHe is not alone in his pessimism. ‘The question now is: what will Pfizer–Allergan buy next. Or it could start spinning things off, but where is it going to get new drugs from?’ asks Brozak. ‘I would like to see the people responsible for drug discovery and innovation to just say no to the accountants and the corporate finance mavens that are basically driving these entities,’ he says. ‘What I care about is the value of the shares tomorrow, and that isn’t driven by tax codes. It is driven by discovery of new healthcare products and technologies.’\nThe hurdles ahead\nThe new company will have better access to cash to invest in R&D and manufacturing, according to Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive . ‘I want to stress that we are not doing this transaction simply as a tax transaction. We are doing this because of the strategic importance of the franchises, the revenue growth we believe we can get within the US and internationally, and the importance to combine the research approaches,’ Read said on Monday in a call with analysts.\nThe move also gives Allergan access to 70 markets it does not operate in today. Allergan chief executive Brent Saunders said during the call with analysts that the company has almost zero presence in some of the biggest markets, such as Japan, the second biggest pharmaceutical market in the world. ‘You have a multi-billion dollar business in Pfizer that already exists there. We’re trying to figure out how to bring our product flow into Japan in an efficient way. [That] issue is solved through this transaction,’ he said.\nThe new entity will continue to be called Pfizer, with Pfizer stockholders owning around 56% and Allergan shareholders 44%. The deal must be approved by both sets of shareholders, as well as regulators in the US and the EU.\nThere is concern among investors that the deal could be stymied by the US government. Some analysts say Allergan and Pfizer are understating potential tax and other savings in the face of US political opposition to tax inversions.\nThe union will require 9 months gestation, and analysts say this gives time for the US government to undercut it. Already, the leading US presidential candidates have criticised Pfizer’s actions. But Pfizer has learned from the experience of trying to merge with AstraZeneca last year and has tried to cover all its bases. It neatly sidestepped new rules to impede tax inversions from the US Treasury, which has admitted it can do little more to prevent the deals without legislation from Congress. 	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:06.015354-06

New Line of BLT: Bacon, Lipitor, and Tomato.\nLast night’s unexpected merger between Pfizer and McDonald’s sent shock waves through Wall Street, the Pharmaceutical industry and the heavily-processed meat community.\n“It was a no-brainer, really” remarked Pfizer CEO Ian Read. ‘These beloved brands have long enjoyed a symbiotic corporate relationship.  We finally decided that as long as McDonald’s is creating new patients for our medications – medications which keep their consumers alive and able to keep walking back to enjoy those 99-cent specials - why not work together?’\nThe top-secret negotiations, months in the making, sent stock prices soaring as McDonald’s franchises unveiled a new "McHealth Menu" that reflects the revised business model of McDonald’s/Pfizer (now listed as ‘McPfiz’ on the S&P 500).\n‘The New McBLT, featuring Bacon, Lipitor & Tomato, redefines health & commerce’ says Fred Golgoth, McDonald’s VP of  Globalization & Happy Meal Toy Development.    ‘It’s a logical progression – together we’ll give people the tasty food products they love, and, should said products threaten their health, we also provide the drugs to neutralize that threat.”\nNew meals include the  Angus Chipotle Zithromax BBQ Burger, which provides powerful antibiotics to combat fungal infection, in addition to the undetermined antibiotics injected during a cow’s short life before slaughter.       \nCustomer activity indicates strong approval for the merger amongst McDonald’s regulars.  At a franchise in Bullwhallop, Texas, hungry diner Sue Gompfolker opted for the Premium Crispy Chicken McLyrica Classic.  “I’ve got a generalized anxiety disorder, and this allows me to get the anticonvulsant I need, with the bacon I crave.”\nMs.  Gompfolker’s elderly mother,  Anna, opted for the Big N’ Tasty Celebrex  Burger with Mushrooms & Swiss.  “Why should I worry about the colon polyps when I’m also eating the cure?” she merrily chirped from her mechanized scooter.  \nUpcoming entrees include the Premium Honey Mustard Diflucan Wrap (with co-pay),  the Southern Style Grilled McDouble Viagra Wrap (Ranch),  and the all-new McZyloprimRib with Red Meat Wrap for gout sufferers.\n“It’s the circle of life” remarked McDonald’s VP Golgoth. “Pfizer had the vision to partner with the largest fast-food chain in the world.”   When reminded that Subway recently surpassed McDonald’s as the largest chain,  Golgoth replied “Yes, but we’ve still got the largest customers.”  Subway is rumored to be in talks with Merck.\nThe newly merged company has already secured preliminary approval from Health and Human Services for Medicare and Medicaid to cover the cost of McDonald's Health Menu meals. A small co-pay may be required where brand-name drugs are used, or HHS deems the health-threat of McIngredients to be abnormally high.\nFuture corporate plans include development of a nationwide Insurance Provider Network, tentatively titled ‘McHMO.’ 	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:06.010848-06

Time to think. “Please Sir I want some more” says the cry of illness. When the cost of medicine is too expensive to treat the ill such a merger makes no sense. Recommend\nPfizer's three acquisitions in the chart alone were worth about $240 billion, yet Pfizer's current market cap is only about $200 billion. Feels like a giant value destruction machine, or am I missing something? Recommend\nA_Passer-by Nov 24th 2015 14:39 GMT\nLOL...old women need BOTOX and old men require VIAGRA. That suits 100% Recommend\n2 Report Permalink reply\nKeats0 Nov 24th 2015 8:28 GMT\nI've always argued to my ultraliberal friends corporations are not evil but I do always admit one exception: pharmaceutical companies. The fact that people in the US die because drug companies set such high prices and their insurance won't pay for their treatment because it's too expensive (as a result of drug companies cornering the market and price gouging as a result) is exactly why mergers like this are an awful idea. And as an avid traveler who ranks Ireland my #1 favorite country in the world I think the Irish government should be ashamed of themselves for accommodating these sort of mergers.\nTrust me, I'm not putting the US government on a pedestal, far from it. But this kind of nonsense is exactly how Trump and Co. get support for slashing corporate taxes. Recommend\n6 Report Permalink reply\nI hope the Commerce Department or the Justice Department will veto the merger. It will mean nothing but bad news for the consumer. Recommend\nThe government can still veto it as this combination will limit competition in the US marketplace.

85	3	With $160 billion merger, Pfizer moves to Ireland and dodges taxes ...	http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/with-160-billion-merger-pfizer-moves-to-ireland-and-dodges-taxes/	Nov 23, 2015 ... Small Dublin-based Allergan will buy Pfizer to form world's largest drug maker.	25	\N	With $160 billion merger, Pfizer moves to Ireland and dodges taxes\nSmall Dublin-based Allergan will buy Pfizer to form world’s largest drug maker.\nby Beth Mole - Nov 23, 2015 5:59 pm UTC\nIn what’s called a “reverse-inversion,” Allergan, a small Dublin-based drug company that makes products such as Botox, will technically buy the US-based pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer, which makes products such as Viagra and Lipitor.\nThe $160 billion merger, officially announced Monday , will allow Pfizer to move its executive offices to Ireland, thus lowering its tax rate, while also morphing into the world’s largest drug maker.\nSuch inversions, which are said to cost the American government billions in lost tax revenue, have drawn scorn from the Obama Administration and the Treasury Department. Last year, President Obama referred to the deals as “ unpatriotic” loopholes and proposed to close them. And last week, the Treasury announced new rules to make such deals more difficult.\nBut Pfizer’s reverse-inversion skirts the rules, in part by keeping ownership split somewhat evenly between the two companies. After the deal is complete, current shareholders of Allergan, which has the majority of its operations in the US, will own 44 percent of the mega company. The remaining 56 percent will be owned by current Pfizer shareholders.\nIn Monday’s announcement, Pfizer said that the deal will deliver $2 billion in cost savings per year for the first three years. By 2018, the combined company, which will also be called Pfizer, will have an operating cash flow of $25 billion.\nThe merged company will also enjoy a 17 to 18 percent tax rate, Pfizer said. That’s down from Pfizer’s current US tax rate of about 25 percent .\nChairman and CEO of Pfizer Ian Read was quoted in the announcement as saying, “The proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover, and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.”\nThe company said it expects that the deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, will be done by the second half of 2016. Lawmakers and healthcare professionals are currently monitoring and investigating  such large mergers between pharmaceutical companies and their impacts on healthcare costs.\nLatest Feature Story Feature Story (2 pages) Pixel C review—New hardware ignores an Android tablet’s core problem: software	txt		""	0		f	\N	\N	2015-12-08 17:05:06.006599-06
